Problem: Three couples go to the movie theater. They want to seat people together for maximum enjoyment, but instead they randomly file into a row with six seats. What is the probability that they sit in a socially optimal configuration, in which each person is sitting next to his or her partner?
Model Response: To find the probability that three couples sit together in a socially optimal configuration, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Arrangements**: First, we calculate the total number of ways to arrange 6 people in a row. This is given by the factorial of the number of people:
   \[
   6! = 720
   \]

2. **Arrangements with Couples Together**: Next, we consider the arrangements where each couple sits together. We can treat each couple as a single unit or block. Thus, we have 3 blocks (couples) to arrange.

   - The number of ways to arrange these 3 blocks is:
   \[
   3! = 6
   \]

   - Within each block, the two individuals can switch places. Since there are 3 couples, the number of arrangements within the blocks is:
   \[
   2^3 = 8
   \]

   - Therefore, the total number of arrangements where each couple sits together is:
   \[
   3! \times 2^3 = 6 \times 8 = 48
   \]

3. **Probability Calculation**: The probability that the couples sit together is the ratio of the number of favorable arrangements (couples together) to the total arrangements:
   \[
   P(\text{couples together}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable arrangements}}{\text{Total arrangements}} = \frac{48}{720}
   \]

   Simplifying this fraction:
   \[
   P(\text{couples together}) = \frac{48 \div 48}{720 \div 48} = \frac{1}{15}
   \]

Thus, the probability that the couples sit in a socially optimal configuration is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{15}}
\]

Problem: Three couples go to the movie theater. They want to seat people together for maximum enjoyment, but instead they randomly file into a row with six seats. What is the probability that they sit in a socially optimal configuration, in which each person is sitting next to his or her partner?
Model Response: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of ways the three couples can sit together in a socially optimal configuration and the total number of ways they can sit in general.

1. **Total number of arrangements without restrictions**:
   There are 6 people, so the total number of arrangements is given by \(6!\):
   \[
   6! = 720
   \]

2. **Total number of arrangements with couples sitting together**:
   We can treat each couple as a single unit or block. Since there are 3 couples, we can think of them as 3 blocks. The number of ways to arrange these 3 blocks is \(3!\):
   \[
   3! = 6
   \]
   Within each block (couple), the two individuals can switch places, so for each couple, there are \(2!\) arrangements. Since there are 3 couples, the total arrangements for the couples is \(2^3\):
   \[
   2^3 = 8
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of arrangements where each couple sits together is:
   \[
   3! \times 2^3 = 6 \times 8 = 48
   \]

3. **Calculating the probability**:
   The probability that the couples sit together is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total outcomes:
   \[
   P(\text{couples sit together}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{48}{720}
   \]
   Simplifying this fraction:
   \[
   \frac{48}{720} = \frac{1}{15}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{15}}

Problem: A restaurant offers three desserts, and exactly twice as many appetizers as main courses. A dinner consists of an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert. What is the least number of main courses that the restaurant should offer so that a customer could have a different dinner each night in the year 2003?
Model Response: To determine the least number of main courses that the restaurant should offer so that a customer could have a different dinner each night in the year 2003, we need to calculate the total number of different dinners possible based on the number of appetizers, main courses, and desserts.

Let:
- \( m \) = number of main courses
- \( a \) = number of appetizers
- \( d \) = number of desserts

According to the problem, the restaurant offers:
- 3 desserts, so \( d = 3 \)
- Exactly twice as many appetizers as main courses, so \( a = 2m \)

A dinner consists of one appetizer, one main course, and one dessert. Therefore, the total number of different dinners \( N \) can be calculated as:

\[
N = a \times m \times d
\]

Substituting the values of \( a \) and \( d \):

\[
N = (2m) \times m \times 3 = 6m^2
\]

We need \( N \) to be at least the number of days in the year 2003. Since 2003 is not a leap year, it has 365 days. Therefore, we set up the inequality:

\[
6m^2 \geq 365
\]

To find the minimum \( m \), we first solve for \( m^2 \):

\[
m^2 \geq \frac{365}{6} \approx 60.8333
\]

Taking the square root of both sides gives:

\[
m \geq \sqrt{60.8333} \approx 7.8
\]

Since \( m \) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number:

\[
m \geq 8
\]

Now, we check if \( m = 8 \) satisfies the original condition:

\[
N = 6m^2 = 6 \times 8^2 = 6 \times 64 = 384
\]

Since 384 is greater than 365, \( m = 8 \) is sufficient.

Thus, the least number of main courses that the restaurant should offer is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]

Problem: A restaurant offers three desserts, and exactly twice as many appetizers as main courses. A dinner consists of an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert. What is the least number of main courses that the restaurant should offer so that a customer could have a different dinner each night in the year 2003?
Model Response: To solve the problem, we need to determine the least number of main courses (let's denote it as \( m \)) such that the total number of different dinners exceeds the number of days in the year 2003.

1. **Identify the number of desserts and appetizers:**
   - The restaurant offers 3 desserts.
   - The number of appetizers is twice the number of main courses, so the number of appetizers is \( 2m \).

2. **Calculate the total number of different dinners:**
   - A dinner consists of one appetizer, one main course, and one dessert.
   - Therefore, the total number of different dinners can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total dinners} = (\text{Number of appetizers}) \times (\text{Number of main courses}) \times (\text{Number of desserts}) = (2m) \times m \times 3 = 6m^2
     \]

3. **Determine the number of days in the year 2003:**
   - The year 2003 is not a leap year, so it has 365 days.

4. **Set up the inequality:**
   - We want the total number of dinners to be at least 365:
     \[
     6m^2 \geq 365
     \]

5. **Solve for \( m \):**
   - Dividing both sides by 6:
     \[
     m^2 \geq \frac{365}{6} \approx 60.8333
     \]
   - Taking the square root of both sides:
     \[
     m \geq \sqrt{60.8333} \approx 7.8
     \]
   - Since \( m \) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number:
     \[
     m \geq 8
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The least number of main courses that the restaurant should offer is \( m = 8 \).

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{8}\).

Problem: Ten circles are all the same size. Each pair of these circles overlap but no circle is exactly on top of another circle. What is the greatest possible total number of intersection points of these ten circles?
Model Response: To find the greatest possible total number of intersection points of ten circles, we start by considering how many intersection points can occur between any two circles.

Each pair of circles can intersect at most at 2 points. Therefore, if we have \( n \) circles, the number of ways to choose 2 circles from \( n \) is given by the binomial coefficient \( \binom{n}{2} \). The formula for the binomial coefficient is:

\[
\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\]

For \( n = 10 \):

\[
\binom{10}{2} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2} = 45
\]

Since each pair of circles can intersect at 2 points, the total number of intersection points \( I \) for 10 circles is:

\[
I = 2 \times \binom{10}{2} = 2 \times 45 = 90
\]

Thus, the greatest possible total number of intersection points of these ten circles is:

\[
\boxed{90}

Problem: Ten circles are all the same size. Each pair of these circles overlap but no circle is exactly on top of another circle. What is the greatest possible total number of intersection points of these ten circles?
Model Response: To find the greatest possible total number of intersection points of ten circles, we can use the formula for the number of intersection points between two circles. Each pair of circles can intersect at most at 2 points.

First, we need to determine how many pairs of circles can be formed from 10 circles. The number of ways to choose 2 circles from 10 is given by the combination formula:

\[
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of circles and \( r \) is the number of circles to choose (in this case, 2).

For our case:

\[
\binom{10}{2} = \frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2 \times 1} = 45
\]

Since each pair of circles can intersect at most at 2 points, the total number of intersection points for 10 circles is:

\[
\text{Total intersection points} = 2 \times \binom{10}{2} = 2 \times 45 = 90
\]

Thus, the greatest possible total number of intersection points of these ten circles is:

In order to increase the number of plates available, the state changed the format to four letters followed by two digits. What is the positive difference between the number of plates available with the new format and the number of plates available with the old format?
Model Response: To find the positive difference between the number of license plates available with the old format and the new format, we first need to calculate the total number of plates for each format.

**Old Format: Three letters followed by three digits**

1. **Calculating the number of combinations for letters:**
   - There are 26 letters in the English alphabet.
   - For three letters, the number of combinations is:
     \[
     26^3
     \]

2. **Calculating the number of combinations for digits:**
   - There are 10 digits (0 through 9).
   - For three digits, the number of combinations is:
     \[
     10^3
     \]

3. **Total combinations for the old format:**
   \[
   \text{Total}_{\text{old}} = 26^3 \times 10^3

In order to increase the number of plates available, the state changed the format to four letters followed by two digits. What is the positive difference between the number of plates available with the new format and the number of plates available with the old format?
Model Response: To find the positive difference between the number of license plates available with the old format (three letters followed by three digits) and the new format (four letters followed by two digits), we need to calculate the total number of combinations for each format.

**Old Format: Three Letters Followed by Three Digits**
1. For the letters, there are 26 options (A-Z) for each of the three positions.
2. For the digits, there are 10 options (0-9) for each of the three positions.

The total number of plates for the old format is:
\[
26^3 \times 10^3
\]

Calculating this:
\[
26^3 = 17576 \quad \text{and} \quad 10^3 = 1000
\]
\[
\text{Total for old format} = 17576 \times 1000 = 17576000
\]

**New Format: Four Letters Followed by Two Digits**
1. For the letters, there are 26 options for each of the four positions.
2. For the digits, there are 10 options for each of the two positions.

The total number of plates for the new format is:
\[
26^4 \times 10^2
\]

Calculating this:
\[
26^4 = 456976 \quad \text{and} \quad 10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\text{Total for new format} = 456976 \times 100 = 45697600
\]

**Finding the Positive Difference**
Now, we find the positive difference between the new format and the old format:
\[
\text{Difference} = 45697600 - 17576000 = 28121600
\]

Thus, the positive difference between the number of plates available with the new format and the old format is:

Model Response: To find the probability that Wilhelm marks the correct broken seats, we first need to determine the total number of ways he can choose 4 seats from the 6 available seats.

The number of ways to choose 4 seats from 6 is given by the binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{6}{4}
\]

Calculating this, we have:

\[
\binom{6}{4} = \frac{6!}{4!(6-4)!} = \frac{6!}{4! \cdot 2!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
\]

Next, there is only 1 way for Wilhelm to choose the correct 4 broken seats out of the 6 seats.

Thus, the probability \( P \) that he marks the correct seats is given by the ratio of the number of successful outcomes to the total number of outcomes:

\[
P = \frac{\text{Number of successful outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{1}{15}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{15}}

Model Response: To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that Wilhelm marks the correct four broken seats out of the six available seats.

1. **Identify the total number of ways to choose 4 seats from 6**: This can be calculated using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} \), where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, and \( k \) is the number of items to choose.

   \[
   \text{Total ways to choose 4 seats from 6} = \binom{6}{4} = \frac{6!}{4!(6-4)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15

2. **Identify the number of successful outcomes**: There is only 1 way to choose the correct 4 broken seats since there is only one specific combination of broken seats.

3. **Calculate the probability**: The probability is given by the ratio of the number of successful outcomes to the total number of outcomes.

Problem: A standard die is rolled. What is the probability that the number shown is not an even prime?
Model Response: A standard die has six faces, numbered from 1 to 6. The even prime numbers are those that are both even and prime. The only even prime number is 2.

Now, we need to find the probability that the number shown on the die is not an even prime. 

The total number of outcomes when rolling a die is 6 (the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6).

The only outcome that is an even prime is 2. Therefore, the outcomes that are not an even prime are 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6. 

Counting these outcomes, we have:
- Not an even prime: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 (5 outcomes)

Thus, the probability of rolling a number that is not an even prime is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:

\[
P(\text{not an even prime}) = \frac{\text{Number of outcomes not an even prime}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{5}{6}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

Problem: A customer ordered 15 pieces of gourmet chocolate. The order can be packaged in small boxes that contain 1, 2 or 4 pieces of chocolate. Any box that is used must be full. How many different combinations of boxes can be used for the customer's 15 chocolate pieces? One such combination to be included is to use seven 2-piece boxes and one 1-piece box.
Model Response: To solve the problem of how many different combinations of boxes can be used to package 15 pieces of gourmet chocolate using boxes that contain 1, 2, or 4 pieces, we can define the variables:

- Let \( x_1 \) be the number of 1-piece boxes.
- Let \( x_2 \) be the number of 2-piece boxes.
- Let \( x_3 \) be the number of 4-piece boxes.

We need to find the non-negative integer solutions to the equation:

\[
x_1 + 2x_2 + 4x_3 = 15
\]

We will consider different values for \( x_3 \) (the number of 4-piece boxes) and find the corresponding values for \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \).

### Case 1: \( x_3 = 0 \)

The equation simplifies to:

\[
x_1 + 2x_2 = 15
\]

The possible values for \( x_2 \) range from 0 to 7 (since \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) and \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) exceeds 15). For each \( x_2 \), \( x_1 \) can be calculated as:

- \( x_2 = 0 \): \( x_1 = 15 \) (1 solution)
- \( x_2 = 1 \): \( x_1 = 13 \) (1 solution)
- \( x_2 = 2 \): \( x_1 = 11 \) (1 solution)
- \( x_2 = 3 \): \( x_1 = 9 \) (1 solution)
- \( x_2 = 4 \): \( x_1 = 7 \) (1 solution)
- \( x_2 = 5 \): \( x_1 = 5 \) (1 solution)
- \( x_2 = 6 \): \( x_1 = 3 \) (1 solution)
- \( x_2 = 7 \): \( x_1 = 1 \) (1 solution)

   Possible values for \( x_2 \) are from 0 to 7 (since \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) and \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) exceeds 15). For each \( x_2 \), \( x_1 \) can be calculated as \( 15 - 2x_2 \). This gives us 8 combinations (from \( x_2 = 0 \) to \( x_2 = 7 \)).

2. **If \( x_3 = 1 \)**:
   \[
   x_1 + 2x_2 = 11
   \]
   Possible values for \( x_2 \) are from 0 to 5 (since \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) and \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) exceeds 11). This gives us 6 combinations.

3. **If \( x_3 = 2 \)**:
   \[
   x_1 + 2x_2 = 7
   \]
   Possible values for \( x_2 \) are from 0 to 3 (since \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) and \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) exceeds 7). This gives us 4 combinations.

4. **If \( x_3 = 3 \)**:
   \[
   x_1 + 2x_2 = 3
   \]
   Possible values for \( x_2 \) are from 0 to 1 (since \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) and \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) exceeds 3). This gives us 2 combinations.

5. **If \( x_3 = 4 \)**:
   \[
   x_1 + 2x_2 = -1
   \]
   This case is not possible since \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) cannot be negative.

Now, we can sum the combinations from each case:
- For \( x_3 = 0 \): 8 combinations
- For \( x_3 = 1 \): 6 combinations
- For \( x_3 = 2 \): 4 combinations
- For \( x_3 = 3 \): 2 combinations

Total combinations:
\[
8 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 20
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

Problem: Jack rolls 5 fair six-sided dice. What is the probability that at least two dice show the same number?
Model Response: To find the probability that at least two of the five dice show the same number, we can use the complementary probability approach. First, we will calculate the probability that all five dice show different numbers, and then subtract this from 1.

1. **Total outcomes when rolling 5 dice**: Each die has 6 faces, so the total number of outcomes when rolling 5 dice is:
   \[
   6^5
   \]

2. **Favorable outcomes for all different numbers**: To find the number of ways to roll 5 dice such that all show different numbers, we can choose 5 different numbers from the 6 available numbers. The number of ways to choose 5 different numbers from 6 is given by the combination \( \binom{6}{5} \), and then we can arrange these 5 numbers in \( 5! \) ways. Thus, the number of favorable outcomes is:
   \[
   \binom{6}{5} \times 5! = 6 \times 120 = 720
   \]

3. **Calculating the probability of all different numbers**: The probability that all five dice show different numbers is then:
   \[
   P(\text{all different}) = \frac{\text{favorable outcomes}}{\text{total outcomes}} = \frac{720}{6^5}
   \]
   Calculating \( 6^5 \):
   \[
   6^5 = 7776
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   P(\text{all different}) = \frac{720}{7776} = \frac{5}{54}
   \]

4. **Calculating the probability of at least two dice showing the same number**: The probability that at least two dice show the same number is the complement of the probability that all dice show different numbers:
   \[
   P(\text{at least one pair}) = 1 - P(\text{all different}) = 1 - \frac{5}{54} = \frac{54 - 5}{54} = \frac{49}{54}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{49}{54}}

   Each die has 6 faces, so the total number of outcomes when rolling 5 dice is:
   \[
   6^5 = 7776
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of outcomes where all dice show different numbers**:
   For the first die, there are 6 options. For the second die, there are 5 options (to avoid matching the first), for the third die, there are 4 options, for the fourth die, there are 3 options, and for the fifth die, there are 2 options. Thus, the number of ways to roll 5 dice with all different numbers is:
   \[
   6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 = 720
   \]

3. **Calculate the probability that all dice show different numbers**:
   The probability that all dice show different numbers is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total outcomes:
   \[
   P(\text{all different}) = \frac{720}{7776} = \frac{5}{54}
   \]

Problem: Determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word NINE.
Model Response: To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word "NINE", we first note that the word consists of 4 letters where the letter 'N' appears twice and the letter 'I' and 'E' each appear once.

The formula for the number of arrangements of letters in a word where some letters are repeated is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the repeated letters.

In the case of "NINE":
- Total letters, \( n = 4 \)
- The letter 'N' appears 2 times, so \( n_1 = 2 \)
- The letter 'I' appears 1 time, so \( n_2 = 1 \)
- The letter 'E' appears 1 time, so \( n_3 = 1 \)

Now we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Number of arrangements} = \frac{4!}{2! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!}
\]

Calculating the factorials:

\[
4! = 24, \quad 2! = 2, \quad 1! = 1
\]

Now substituting these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Number of arrangements} = \frac{24}{2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1} = \frac{24}{2} = 12
\]

Thus, the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word "NINE" is \(\boxed{12}\).

Problem: When Trilisa takes pictures, they turn out with probability $\frac{1}{5}$. She wants to take enough pictures so that the probability of at least one turning out is at least $\frac{3}{4}$. How few pictures can she take to accomplish this?
Model Response: To find the minimum number of pictures Trilisa needs to take so that the probability of at least one picture turning out is at least \(\frac{3}{4}\), we can start by calculating the probability of none of the pictures turning out.

Let \( n \) be the number of pictures taken. The probability that a single picture does not turn out is:

\[
1 - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}
\]

Thus, the probability that all \( n \) pictures do not turn out is:

\[
\left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^n
\]

The probability that at least one picture turns out is the complement of the probability that none turn out:

\[
P(\text{at least one turns out}) = 1 - P(\text{none turn out}) = 1 - \left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^n
\]

We want this probability to be at least \(\frac{3}{4}\):

\[
1 - \left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^n \geq \frac{3}{4}
\]

Subtracting 1 from both sides gives:

\[
-\left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^n \geq -\frac{1}{4}
\]

Multiplying both sides by -1 (which reverses the inequality) results in:

\[
\left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^n \leq \frac{1}{4}
\]

Next, we can take the logarithm of both sides to solve for \( n \):

\[
n \log\left( \frac{4}{5} \right) \leq \log\left( \frac{1}{4} \right)
\]

Since \(\log\left( \frac{4}{5} \right)\) is negative, we can divide by it (which will flip the inequality):

\[
n \geq \frac{\log\left( \frac{1}{4} \right)}{\log\left( \frac{4}{5} \right)}
\]

Calculating the logarithms:

\[
\log\left( \frac{1}{4} \right) = \log(1) - \log(4) = 0 - \log(4) =

Model Response: To find the minimum number of pictures Trilisa needs to take so that the probability of at least one picture turning out is at least \(\frac{3}{4}\), we can use the complement probability.

1. The probability that a single picture does not turn out is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}
   \]

2. If she takes \(n\) pictures, the probability that none of them turn out is:
   \[
   \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^n
   \]

3. Therefore, the probability that at least one picture turns out is:
   \[
   1 - \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^n
   \]

4. We want this probability to be at least \(\frac{3}{4}\):
   \[
   1 - \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^n \geq \frac{3}{4}
   \]

5. Rearranging gives:
   \[
   \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^n \leq \frac{1}{4}
   \]

6. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
   \[
   n \ln\left(\frac{4}{5}\right) \leq \ln\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)
   \]

7. Since \(\ln\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)\) is negative, we can divide by it (which reverses the inequality):
   \[
   n \geq \frac{\ln\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)}{\ln\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)}
   \]

8. Calculating the values:
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) = -\ln(4) \approx -1.3863
   \]
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{4}{5}\right) \approx -0.2231
   \]

9. Now, substituting these values:
   \[
   n \geq \frac{-1.3863}{-0.2231} \approx 6.21
   \]

Since \(n\) must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number:
\[
n = 7
\]

Thus, the minimum number of pictures Trilisa needs to take is \(\boxed{7}\).

Model Response: To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum and minimum values that can be obtained in the top cell when three different one-digit positive integers are placed in the bottom row.

Let the three different one-digit positive integers be \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). The possible values for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are from the set \( \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\} \).

The process of summing the adjacent cells can be described as follows:

1. The bottom row contains \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
2. The second row will contain:
   - The left cell: \( a + b \)
   - The right cell: \( b + c \)
3. The top cell will then contain:
   - The value: \( (a + b) + (b + c) = a + 2b + c \)

Thus, the value in the top cell is given by the expression \( a + 2b + c \).

### Finding the Maximum Value

To maximize \( a + 2b + c \), we should maximize \( b \) (since it is multiplied by 2) and choose the largest possible values for \( a \) and \( c \) that are different from \( b \).

1. Let \( b = 9 \) (the largest one-digit integer).
2. The next largest integers for \( a \) and \( c \) would be \( 8 \) and \( 7 \).

Calculating the maximum:
\[
a + 2b + c = 8 + 2 \cdot 9 + 7 = 8 + 18 + 7 = 33
\]

### Finding the Minimum Value

To minimize \( a + 2b + c \), we should minimize \( b \) and choose the smallest possible values for \( a \) and \( c \) that are different from \( b \).

1. Let \( b = 1 \) (the smallest one-digit integer).
2. The next smallest integers for \( a \) and \( c \) would be \( 2 \) and \( 3 \).

Calculating the minimum:

a + 2b + c = 2 + 2 \cdot

Model Response: To solve the problem, we need to determine the largest and smallest numbers that can be obtained in the top cell after performing the addition process with three different one-digit positive integers.

Let's denote the three different one-digit positive integers as \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). The possible values for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are from 1 to 9.

### Step 1: Calculate the top cell value

The values in the bottom row are \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). The values in the second row will be:
- The left cell: \( a + b \)
- The right cell: \( b + c \)

The value in the top cell will then be:
\[
(a + b) + (b + c) = a + 2b + c
\]

### Step 2: Find the maximum value

To maximize \( a + 2b + c \), we should choose the largest possible values for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). The largest one-digit positive integers are 7, 8, and 9. 

Let's assign:
- \( a = 7 \)
- \( b = 8 \)
- \( c = 9 \)

Now, calculate:
\[
7 + 2 \times 8 + 9 = 7 + 16 + 9 = 32
\]

### Step 3: Find the minimum value

To minimize \( a + 2b + c \), we should choose the smallest possible values for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). The smallest one-digit positive integers are 1, 2, and 3.

Let's assign:
- \( a = 1 \)
- \( b = 2 \)
- \( c = 3 \)

Now, calculate:
\[
1 + 2 \times 2 + 3 = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the difference

Now, we find the difference between the largest and smallest values obtained in the top cell:
\[
32 - 8 = 24

Problem: Each of five, standard, six-sided dice is rolled once. Two of the dice come up the same, but the other three are all different from those two and different from each other. The pair is set aside, and the other three dice are re-rolled. The dice are said to show a "full house" if three of the dice show the same value and the other two show the same value (and potentially, but not necessarily, all five dice show the same value). What is the probability that after the second set of rolls, the dice show a full house?
Model Response: To find the probability that after the second set of rolls, the dice show a full house, we need to analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Initial Roll**: We roll five dice, and we know that two of them show the same value (let's call this value \( A \)), and the other three show different values (let's call them \( B, C, D \)). 

2. **Re-rolling the Three Different Dice**: We will re-roll the three dice showing \( B, C, D \). We want to find the probability that after re-rolling these three dice, we end up with a full house.

3. **Conditions for a Full House**: A full house consists of three dice showing one value and two dice showing another value. In our case, we already have two dice showing value \( A \). For the re-rolled dice to form a full house, we need:
   - One of the re-rolled dice to match \( A \) (to make three of a kind).
   - The other two re-rolled dice must show the same value, which we will call \( X \), different from \( A \).

4. **Calculating the Probability**:
   - The probability that at least one of the three re-rolled dice shows \( A \) can be calculated using the complement:
     - The probability that a single die does not show \( A \) is \( \frac{5}{6} \).
     - Therefore, the probability that none of the three dice show \( A \) is \( \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{216} \).
     - Thus, the probability that at least one die shows \( A \) is:
       \[
       1 - \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3 = 1 - \frac{125}{216} = \frac{91}{216}.
       \]

5. **Choosing the Value for the Other Two Dice**:
   - If at least one die shows \( A \), we need the other two dice to show the same value \( X \) (which must be different from \( A \)).
   - There are 5 possible values for \( X \) (the values 1 through 6, excluding \( A \)).
   - The probability that both remaining dice show the same value \( X \) is:

What is the probability that after the second set of rolls, the dice show a full house?
Model Response: To find the probability of rolling a full house after the second set of rolls, we need to analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Initial Setup**: We have rolled five dice, and we know that two of them are the same (let's call this value \( A \)), and the other three are all different from each other and from \( A \) (let's call these values \( B, C, D \)).

2. **Re-rolling the Three Different Dice**: We will re-roll the three different dice \( B, C, D \). For a full house, we need to get three of one value and two of another value. Since we already have two dice showing \( A \), we need to roll three dice that will match either \( A \) or one of the new values.

3. **Calculating Successful Outcomes**:
   - To achieve a full house, we can either:
     - Roll three dice that all show \( A \) (which would give us a full house of \( A, A, A, B, B \)).
     - Roll two dice that show one of the new values (let's say \( B \)) and one die that shows \( A \) (which would give us a full house of \( A, A, B, B, C \)).
     - Roll two dice that show another new value (let's say \( C \)) and one die that shows \( A \) (which would give us a full house of \( A, A, B, C, C \)).
     - Roll two dice that show the same new value (let's say \( B \)) and one die that shows another new value (let's say \( C \)) (which would give us a full house of \( A, A, B, B, C \)).

4. **Calculating Total Outcomes**:
   - Each die has 6 faces, and since we are rolling 3 dice, the total number of outcomes when rolling 3 dice is \( 6^3 = 216 \).

5. **Calculating Successful Outcomes**:
   - **Case 1**: All three dice show \( A \): There is only 1 way to achieve this.
   - **Case 2**: Two dice show \( B \) and one die shows \( A \): The number of ways to choose which two of the three dice show \( B \) is \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \).
   - **Case 3**: Two dice show \( C \) and one die shows \( A \): Similarly, there are \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) ways.
   - **Case 4**: Two dice show \( B \) and one die shows \( C \): The number of ways to choose which two of the three dice show \( B \) is \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \).

   Therefore, the total number of successful outcomes is:
   \[
   1 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 10
   \]

6. **Calculating the Probability**:
   The probability of rolling a full house after the second set of rolls is given by the ratio of successful outcomes to total outcomes:
   \[
   P(\text{full house}) = \frac{\text{Number of successful outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{10}{216} = \frac{5}{108}
   \]

Finally, the probability that after the second set of rolls, the dice show a full house is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{5}{108}}

Model Response: To compute \(\dbinom{13}{4} + \dbinom{13}{9}\), we can use the identity that relates binomial coefficients:

In this case, we have:

\[
4! = 24
\]
\[
9! = 362880
\]
\[
13! = 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9! = 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 362880
\]

However, we can simplify the calculation of \(\dbinom{13}{4}\) directly:

\[
\dbinom{13}{4} = \frac{13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}
\]

Calculating the numerator:

\[
13 \times 12 = 156
\]
\[
156 \times 11 = 1716
\]
\[
1716 \times 10 = 17160
\]

Now calculating the denominator:

\[
4 \times 3 = 12
\]
\[
12 \times 2 = 24
\]
\[
24 \times 1 = 24
\]

Now we can compute \(\dbinom{13}{4}\):

\[
\dbinom{13}{4} = \frac{17160}{24} = 715
\]

Thus, we have:

\[

Problem: Compute $\dbinom{13}{4}+\dbinom{13}{9}$.
Model Response: To compute \(\dbinom{13}{4} + \dbinom{13}{9}\), we can use the property of binomial coefficients that states:

\[
\dbinom{n}{k} = \dbinom{n}{n-k}
\]

In this case, we have:

\[
\dbinom{13}{9} = \dbinom{13}{13-9} = \dbinom{13}{4}
\]

Thus, we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\dbinom{13}{4} + \dbinom{13}{9} = \dbinom{13}{4} + \dbinom{13}{4} = 2 \cdot \dbinom{13}{4}
\]

Now, we need to calculate \(\dbinom{13}{4}\):

\[
\dbinom{13}{4} = \frac{13!}{4!(13-4)!} = \frac{13!}{4! \cdot 9!}
\]

Calculating \(13!\), \(4!\), and \(9!\):

\[
13! = 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9!
\]
\[
4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24
\]
\[
9! = 9!
\]

Substituting back into the binomial coefficient:

\[
\dbinom{13}{4} = \frac{13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{24}
\]

Calculating the numerator:

\[
13 \times 12 = 156
\]
\[
156 \times 11 = 1716
\]
\[
1716 \times 10 = 17160
\]

Now, divide by \(24\):

\[
\dbinom{13}{4} = \frac{17160}{24} = 715
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\dbinom{13}{4} + \dbinom{13}{9} = 2 \cdot 715 = 1430
\]

Finally, the answer is:

\[
\boxed{1430}
\]

Problem: If you flip a fair coin four times, what is the probability of flipping at least three heads in a row? Express your answer as a common fraction.
Model Response: To find the probability of flipping at least three heads in a row when flipping a fair coin four times, we can analyze the possible outcomes.

First, let's denote the outcomes of the four flips as sequences of H (heads) and T (tails). The total number of outcomes when flipping a coin four times is:

\[
2^4 = 16
\]

Next, we will identify the sequences that contain at least three consecutive heads (HHH). The possible cases are:

1. **HHHT**: The first three flips are heads, and the last flip is tails.
2. **HHTH**: The first two flips are heads, the third is tails, and the last is heads.
3. **HHTT**: The first two flips are heads, the last two are tails.
4. **THHH**: The first flip is tails, and the last three flips are heads.
5. **HHHH**: All four flips are heads.

Now, let's list the valid sequences that contain at least three consecutive heads:

- HHHH
- HHHT
- HHTH
- HHTT
- THHH

Now, we can count these sequences:

1. HHHH
2. HHHT
3. THHH

Thus, we have a total of 5 sequences that contain at least three consecutive heads.

Now, we can calculate the probability of getting at least three heads in a row:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{5}{16}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{5}{16}}

Problem: If you flip a fair coin four times, what is the probability of flipping at least three heads in a row? Express your answer as a common fraction.
Model Response: To find the probability of flipping at least three heads in a row when flipping a fair coin four times, we can first determine the total number of possible outcomes and then count the successful outcomes that meet our criteria.

1. **Total Outcomes**: When flipping a coin four times, each flip has 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails). Therefore, the total number of outcomes is:
   \[
   2^4 = 16
   \]

2. **Successful Outcomes**: We need to count the outcomes that have at least three heads in a row. The possible cases are:
   - **Case 1**: Three heads in a row (HHH) followed by either H or T.
     - HHHH (4 heads)
     - HHHT (3 heads followed by a tail)
   - **Case 2**: Two heads followed by a tail and then another head (THH).
     - THHH (tail followed by three heads)
   - **Case 3**: One head followed by two tails and then another head (TTH).
     - TTHH (two tails followed by two heads)

Now, let's list the successful outcomes:
- HHHH
- HHHT
- THHH

Thus, we have a total of 4 successful outcomes: HHHH, HHHT, THHH, and TTHH.

3. **Calculating Probability**: The probability of flipping at least three heads in a row is given by the ratio of successful outcomes to total outcomes:
   \[
   P(\text{at least 3 heads in a row}) = \frac{\text{Number of successful outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

Finally, the probability of flipping at least three heads in a row when flipping a fair coin four times is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}

Model Response: To determine how many non-congruent figures can be constructed by attaching two equilateral triangles to the regular pentagon \(ABCDE\), we first need to identify the positions where the triangles can be attached.

The pentagon has 5 edges, and we can denote the edges as follows:
- Edge 1: \(AB\)
- Edge 2: \(BC\)
- Edge 3: \(CD\)
- Edge 4: \(DE\)
- Edge 5: \(EA\)

We can attach the two triangles to any two of these edges. The key point is that the triangles can be attached in different orientations, which may lead to congruent figures.

### Step 1: Choosing the edges
We can choose 2 edges from the 5 available edges. The number of ways to choose 2 edges from 5 is given by the combination formula:

\[
\binom{5}{2} = 10
\]

### Step 2: Considering orientations
For each pair of edges chosen, we can attach the triangles in different orientations. Each triangle can be placed in two orientations (pointing outward or inward). Therefore, for each pair of edges, we have:

- Triangle 1 can be placed in 2 ways (outward or inward).
- Triangle 2 can also be placed in 2 ways (outward or inward).

Thus, for each pair of edges, the number of ways to attach the triangles is:

\[
2 \times 2 = 4
\]

### Step 3: Total configurations
Now, we multiply the number of ways to choose the edges by the number of orientations for each pair:

\[
10 \text{ (ways to choose edges)} \times 4 \text{ (orientations)} = 40
\]

### Step 4: Accounting for congruence
However, not all of these configurations will be non-congruent. We need to consider the symmetries of the pentagon. The regular pentagon has rotational and reflectional symmetries.

The symmetries of the pentagon can be described by the dihedral group \(D_5\), which has 10 symmetries (5 rotations and 5 reflections). We will use Burnside's lemma to count the number of distinct configurations.

### Step 5: Applying Burnside's lemma
We will analyze how many configurations remain unchanged under each symmetry.

Model Response: To determine the number of non-congruent figures that can be constructed by attaching two equilateral triangles to the regular pentagon \(ABCDE\), we need to analyze the possible positions for attaching the triangles.

1. **Identifying Positions**: The pentagon has 5 edges, and we can attach a triangle to any of these edges. Let's denote the edges as follows:
   - Edge 1: \(AB\)
   - Edge 2: \(BC\)
   - Edge 3: \(CD\)
   - Edge 4: \(DE\)
   - Edge 5: \(EA\)

2. **Choosing Positions for the Triangles**: We need to choose 2 edges from the 5 available edges to attach the triangles. The number of ways to choose 2 edges from 5 is given by the combination formula:
   \[
   \binom{5}{2} = 10
   \]

3. **Considering Congruence**: However, we need to consider whether the figures formed by different pairs of edges are congruent. The congruence of the figures depends on the relative positions of the triangles.

   - If we attach triangles to edges that are adjacent (e.g., \(AB\) and \(BC\)), the resulting figure will be different from attaching triangles to non-adjacent edges (e.g., \(AB\) and \(CD\)).
   - If we attach triangles to the same edge, it is not allowed since we can only attach one triangle per edge.

4. **Classifying the Combinations**:
   - **Adjacent Edges**: The pairs of adjacent edges are:
     - \( (AB, BC) \)
     - \( (BC, CD) \)
     - \( (CD, DE) \)
     - \( (DE, EA) \)
     - \( (EA, AB) \)
     This gives us 5 combinations.
   
   - **Non-Adjacent Edges**: The pairs of non-adjacent edges are:
     - \( (AB, CD) \)
     - \( (AB, DE) \)
     - \( (AB, EA) \)
     - \( (BC, DE) \)
     - \( (BC, EA) \)
     - \( (CD, EA) \)
     This gives us 6 combinations.

5. **Counting Non-Congruent Figures**: Since adjacent pairs yield distinct figures and non-adjacent pairs yield distinct figures as well, we can simply add the counts:
   - 5 (adjacent) + 6 (non-adjacent) = 11 non-congruent figures.

Thus, the total number of non-congruent figures that can be constructed is:

\[
\boxed{11}

Problem: For how many ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ is $x+2y =
100$?
Model Response: To find the number of ordered pairs of positive integers \((x, y)\) that satisfy the equation 

\[
x + 2y = 100,
\]

we can rearrange the equation to express \(x\) in terms of \(y\):

\[
x = 100 - 2y.
\]

Since \(x\) must be a positive integer, we require:

\[
100 - 2y > 0.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
100 > 2y \quad \Rightarrow \quad 50 > y \quad \Rightarrow \quad y < 50.
\]

Since \(y\) is a positive integer, the possible values for \(y\) are:

\[
y = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 49.
\]

This gives us a total of \(49\) possible values for \(y\).

For each value of \(y\), we can find a corresponding positive integer \(x\) using the equation \(x = 100 - 2y\). We need to ensure that \(x\) remains positive, which we have already established by the condition \(y < 50\).

Thus, for each of the \(49\) values of \(y\), there is a unique corresponding positive integer \(x\).

Therefore, the total number of ordered pairs \((x, y)\) is 

\[
\boxed{49}.
