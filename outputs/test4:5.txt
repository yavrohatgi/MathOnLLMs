Model Response: Let \( B \), \( S \), and \( M \) represent the number of students playing Basketball, Soccer, and Mathletics, respectively. We know the following:

1. The total number of students is \( 60 \).
2. The number of students playing all three sports is \( 8 \).
3. Half the students play basketball, so \( B = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \).
4. The ratio of the sizes of the teams is \( M : B : S = 4 : 3 : 2 \).

From the ratio, we can express \( M \) and \( S \) in terms of \( B \):

\[
M = \frac{4}{3}B \quad \text{and} \quad S = \frac{2}{3}B
\]

Substituting \( B = 30 \):

\[
M = \frac{4}{3} \times 30 = 40
\]
\[
S = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20
\]

Now we have:

- \( B = 30 \)
- \( S = 20 \)
- \( M = 40 \)

Next, we will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of students playing exactly two teams. Let \( x \) be the number of students playing exactly two teams, and let \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) be the number of students playing exactly Basketball and Soccer, exactly Soccer and Mathletics, and exactly Mathletics and Basketball, respectively.

The total number of students can be expressed as:

\[
|B \cup S \cup M| = |B| + |S| + |M| - |B \cap S| - |S \cap M| - |M \cap B| + |B \cap S \cap M|
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
60 = 30 + 20 + 40 - (a + 8) - (b + 8) - (c + 8) + 8
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
60 = 90 - (a + b + c + 16) + 8
\]
\[
60 = 90 - a - b - c - 8
\]
\[
60 = 82 - a - b - c
\]
\[
a + b + c = 22
\]

Now, the number of students playing exactly two teams is given by:

\[
x = a + b + c
\]

Thus, the number of students playing on exactly two teams is:

\[
\boxed{22}
\]

Model Response: Let \( B \), \( S \), and \( M \) represent the number of students playing Basketball, Soccer, and Mathletics, respectively. We know the following:

1. The total number of students is \( 60 \).
2. The number of students playing all three sports is \( 8 \).
3. Half the students play basketball, so \( B = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \).
4. The ratio of the sizes of the teams is \( M : B : S = 4 : 3 : 2 \).

Let \( M = 4x \), \( B = 3x \), and \( S = 2x \). Since we already know \( B = 30 \), we can set up the equation:

\[
3x = 30 \implies x = 10
\]

Now we can find the sizes of the other teams:

\[
M = 4x = 4 \times 10 = 40
\]
\[
S = 2x = 2 \times 10 = 20
\]

Now we have:

- \( B = 30 \)
- \( S = 20 \)
- \( M = 40 \)

Next, we will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of students playing exactly two teams. Let:

- \( n(B) = 30 \)
- \( n(S) = 20 \)
- \( n(M) = 40 \)
- \( n(B \cap S \cap M) = 8 \)

Let \( x \) be the number of students who play exactly two teams. We denote:

- \( n(B \cap S) \) as the number of students playing both Basketball and Soccer,
- \( n(B \cap M) \) as the number of students playing both Basketball and Mathletics,
- \( n(S \cap M) \) as the number of students playing both Soccer and Mathletics.

Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we have:

\[
n(B \cup S \cup M) = n(B) + n(S) + n(M) - n(B \cap S) - n(B \cap M) - n(S \cap M) + n(B \cap S \cap M)
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
60 = 30 + 20 + 40 - n(B \cap S) - n(B \cap M) - n(S \cap M) + 8
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
60 = 98 - (n(B \cap S) + n(B \cap M) + n(S \cap M))
\]

Let \( a = n(B \cap S) \), \( b = n(B \cap M) \), and \( c = n(S \cap M) \). Then we have:

\[
a + b + c = 38
\]

Now, the number of students playing exactly two teams can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Exactly two teams} = (a - 8) + (b - 8) + (c - 8) = a + b + c - 24
\]

Substituting \( a + b + c = 38 \):

\[
\text{Exactly two teams} = 38 - 24 = 14
\]

Thus, the number of students at the school who play on exactly two teams is:

\[
\boxed{14}
\]

File: 6.json, Question: 1, Reasoning: Symbolic
Model Response: To find the number of non-congruent isosceles triangles with a perimeter of 10 and integer side lengths, we denote the lengths of the sides of the isosceles triangle as \( a, a, b \), where \( a \) is the length of the two equal sides and \( b \) is the length of the base. The perimeter condition gives us the equation:

\[
2a + b = 10
\]

From this, we can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \):

\[
b = 10 - 2a
\]

Next, we need to ensure that the triangle inequality holds. For an isosceles triangle, the triangle inequalities are:

1. \( a + a > b \) (which simplifies to \( 2a > b \))
2. \( a + b > a \) (which simplifies to \( b > 0 \))
3. \( b + a > a \) (which is always true since \( b > 0 \))

Substituting \( b = 10 - 2a \) into the first inequality \( 2a > b \):

\[
2a > 10 - 2a
\]

Adding \( 2a \) to both sides gives:

\[
4a > 10
\]

Dividing both sides by 4 results in:

\[
a > 2.5
\]

Since \( a \) must be an integer, we have:

\[
a \geq 3
\]

Now, substituting \( b = 10 - 2a \) into the second inequality \( b > 0 \):

\[
10 - 2a > 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
10 > 2a
\]

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

\[
5 > a
\]

Thus, we have the bounds for \( a \):

\[
3 \leq a < 5
\]

The integer values for \( a \) that satisfy this inequality are \( a = 3 \) and \( a = 4 \).

Now we will find the corresponding values of \( b \) for these values of \( a \):

1. For \( a = 3 \):
   \[
   b = 10 - 2 \cdot 3 = 10 - 6 = 4
   \]
   The triangle sides are \( 3, 3, 4 \).

2. For \( a = 4 \):
   \[
   b = 10 - 2 \cdot 4 = 10 - 8 = 2
   \]
   The triangle sides are \( 4, 4, 2 \).

Both sets of side lengths \( (3, 3, 4) \) and \( (4, 4, 2) \) form valid isosceles triangles.

Thus, the non-congruent isosceles triangles with integer side lengths and a perimeter of 10 are:

1. Triangle with sides \( 3, 3, 4 \)
2. Triangle with sides \( 4, 4, 2 \)

Therefore, the total number of non-congruent isosceles triangles is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]

The perimeter condition gives us:

\[

From this equation, we can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \):

\[
b = 10 - 2a
\]

Next, we need to ensure that the triangle inequality holds. For an isosceles triangle, the triangle inequalities we need to check are:

1. \( a + a > b \) (which simplifies to \( 2a > b \))
2. \( a + b > a \) (which simplifies to \( b > 0 \))
3. \( b + a > a \) (which is always true since \( b > 0 \))

Substituting \( b = 10 - 2a \) into the inequalities:

1. From \( 2a > b \):
   \[
   2a > 10 - 2a
   \]
   Adding \( 2a \) to both sides gives:
   \[
   4a > 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a > 2.5
   \]

2. From \( b > 0 \):
   \[
   10 - 2a > 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 10 > 2a \quad \Rightarrow \quad 5 > a
   \]

Now we have the bounds for \( a \):
\[
2.5 < a < 5
\]

Since \( a \) must be an integer, the possible integer values for \( a \) are \( 3 \) and \( 4 \).

Now we will calculate \( b \) for these values of \( a \):

- If \( a = 3 \):
  \[
  b = 10 - 2 \cdot 3 = 10 - 6 = 4
  \]
  The triangle sides are \( 3, 3, 4 \).

- If \( a = 4 \):
  \[
  b = 10 - 2 \cdot 4 = 10 - 8 = 2
  \]
  The triangle sides are \( 4, 4, 2 \).

Now we check if these triangles are non-congruent:

- The triangle with sides \( 3, 3, 4 \) is different from the triangle with sides \( 4, 4, 2 \).

Thus, we have found two non-congruent isosceles triangles with integer side lengths and a perimeter of 10.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]
