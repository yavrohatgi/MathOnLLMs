Model Response: To find the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled on three standard dice is three or more, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes and the number of successful outcomes.

1. **Total Outcomes**: Each die has 6 faces, so when rolling three dice, the total number of outcomes is:
   \[
   6 \times 6 \times 6 = 216
   \]

2. **Successful Outcomes**: We need to find the number of outcomes where the sum is less than 3. The only way to achieve a sum of 3 or more is to consider the minimum sum possible with three dice:
   - The minimum sum occurs when all three dice show a 1, which gives a sum of 3.

Since the minimum sum of 3 is achievable, there are no outcomes where the sum is less than 3. Therefore, all outcomes (216) are successful.

3. **Calculating Probability**: The probability that the sum is three or more is given by:
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of successful outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{216}{216} = 1
   \]

4. **Expressing as a Percent**: To express this probability as a percent:
   \[
   1 \times 100\% = 100\%
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{100}
\]

Model Response: To find the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled on three standard dice is three or more, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling three dice.

Each die has 6 faces, so the total number of outcomes when rolling three dice is:

\[
6 \times 6 \times 6 = 216
\]

Next, we need to find the number of outcomes where the sum of the numbers rolled is less than 3. The only way to achieve a sum of less than 3 with three dice is to roll three 1s, which gives a sum of 3. Therefore, there are no outcomes where the sum is less than 3.

Since the minimum sum we can achieve with three dice is 3 (by rolling three 1s), all outcomes will result in a sum of 3 or more.

Thus, the number of favorable outcomes (sum of 3 or more) is:

\[
216
\]

Now, we can calculate the probability:

\[
P(\text{sum} \geq 3) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{216}{216} = 1
\]

To express this probability as a percent, we multiply by 100:

\[
P(\text{sum} \geq 3) \times 100 = 1 \times 100 = 100\%
\]

Finally, the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled will be three or more is:

\[
\boxed{100}
\]
