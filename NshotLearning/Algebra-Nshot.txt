Q1)  The Ten Finger calculator company periodically checks random calculators before shipping crates out to customers. On Wednesday, 12 calculators from each of 64 crates of 144 calculators were tested. Two of the tested calculators were found to be defective. Based on this rate of defect, how many total calculators are expected to be defective?A1) Let’s approach this problem one step at a time.* What fraction of the total calculators were tested? For each crate, 12 out of 144 calculators were tested, so 1/12 of them were tested.* From this, how many total calculators are expected to be defective? We can divide the calculators into 12 groups. Each group will make up 1/12 of the total calculators. When 1/12 of the calculators, or 1 group, were tested, 2 were defective. Therefore, amongst all 12 groups, there will be 12 x 2 = 24 defective calculators.Q2) Sohil has a jar with many marbles. 20% of them are small, 40% are medium, and 40% are large. For each size, 30% of the marbles are red, 20% blue, 40% green, and 10% yellow. Half of large, yellow and small green marbles have a special design on them. What percentage of the total marbles have a special design?A2) We can approach this problem by finding the percentage of large, yellow and small green marbles.* What percent of marbles are large and yellow? Since 40% of the marbles are large and 10% of the large marbles are yellow, 10% ? 40% = 4% of the marbles are large and yellow.* What percent of marbles are small and green? Since 20% of the marbles are small and 40% of the small marbles are green, 20% ? 40% = 8% of the marbles are small and green.* From this, what percent of marbles have a special design? A total of 4% + 8% = 12% of marbles are large and yellow or small and green. Therefore, since half of them have a special design, 1/2 ? 12% = 6% have a special design.Q3) 10 workers from a company each working at a constant rate can build 10 houses in 12 years. However, after 6 years, 5 of them retire. The other workers continue working at the same original rate. The project is falling behind, so 2 years later, the company hires 10 more workers who each work twice as fast as the original workers. After how many total years will the 10 houses be complete?A3) To solve this problem, we will have to use ratios to compare the amount of work being done.* After 6 years, what fraction of the 10 houses will be built? Since 6 years is half of the time needed to build 10 houses, 1/2 of the houses will be completed by 6 years.* In these 2 years, what fraction of the houses will be built? 2 years is 1/6 of the time needed to build all of the houses. However, only 1/2 of the original workers are working. Therefore, in total, 1/2 ? 1/6 = 1/12 of the houses will be built in these 2 years.* Compared to the original rate, how fast do the 5 original and 10 new workers work? Since each of the 10 new workers work 2 times faster than one of the original workers, the 5 original workers that remain and the 10 new workers can do as much work as 5 + 10 ? 2 = 25 original workers. Therefore, with the addition of the new workers, they can work 25/10 = 5/2 times faster.* What fraction of the houses are left to be built? 1/2 of the houses were built in the first 6 years, and 1/12 of the houses were built in the next 2 years, so 1 ? 1/2 ? 1/12 = 12/12 ? 6/12 ? 1/12 = 5/12 of the houses are left to be built.* How long would the 10 original workers have taken to build 5/12 of the houses? Since they could build all of the houses in 12 years, they could build 5/12 of the houses in 5/12 ? 12 = 5 years.* How long will it take the new team of workers to build 5/12 of the houses? The new team of workers can work 5/2 faster than the original team, so they will take 2/5 the time. Therefore, they can build 5/12 of the houses in 2/5 ? 5 = 2 years.* The 10 original workers built 1/2 of the houses in 6 years, the remaining 5 original workers built 1/12 of the houses in 2 years, and the new team of workers built 5/12 of the houses in 2 years. Therefore, the total number of years it took to build the houses is 6 + 2 + 2 = 10.Q4) If  2x + y + z = 36  and x + 2y + z = 40  and x + y + 2z = 32. Find x + y + z.A4) This is a classic equation problem that uses a very powerful technique.* Do you notice anything similar about the equations?  Indeed! All 3 equations have 2 of one of the variables x, y, z and 1 of the other 2 variables. So, the equations are symmetric!* How can we use the symmetry?  Let’s rewrite the equations as follows:  x + (x + y + z) = 36  and y + (x + y + z) = 40 and  z + (x + y + z) = 32.* Notice how each equation simply consists of the sum x + y + z plus an additional x, y, or z. The sum x + y + z reoccurs in every equation.* How can we make another x + y + z term?  We can add all 3 equations together. This will give us  (x + y + z) + 3(x + y + z) = 4(x + y + z) = 36 + 40 + 32 = 108. This simplifies to x + y + z = 27.Q5) Joe needs to get to his office 40 miles away. If he drives at 60 miles per hour, how many minutes will it take him to get to work?A5) This problem is just a direct application of the speed, distance, and time formula.* What information do we know?  The distance is 40 miles. The speed is 60 miles per hour.* How can we calculate the number of minutes?  The number of minutes, a measure of time, can be calculated by dividing distance by speed which is 40 miles / 60 miles per hour = 2/3 hours.* How many minutes will it take? The time we calculated was in hours because the speed was given in miles per hour, so we multiply by 60 to get 60 ? 2/3 to get 40 minutes.Q6) Find the sum of the mean, median, mode, and range of 1, 9, 7, 1, 3, 5, 2.A6) To solve this, we will apply the formulas above.* What is the first step we should do to make analyzing the numbers easier?  We should order them! Doing so, we end up with 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9.* What is the mean?  The mean is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of numbers. The sum of numbers is 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 28. There are 7 numbers. Therefore, the mean is 28/7 = 4.* What is the median?  There are 7 numbers, so the median will just be the middle, or 4th number when the numbers are arranged in increasing order. The 4th number is 3, so the median is also 3.* What is the mode?  The only number that appears more than once is 1, so 1 is the mode.* What is the range?  The range will be the largest number, 9, minus the smallest number, 1, which is equal to 9 ? 1 = 8.* Therefore, the sum of the mean, median, mode, and range is 1 + 3 + 4 + 8 = 16.Q7) A list of 6 distinct positive integers has a mean of 7, a median of 6, and a range of 9. Find the sum of the 2nd and 5th smallest numbers.A7)This problem may seem a little tricky because of how many possibilities there are. Let’s first focus on the median, as there are only a few cases which work.* What are the possibilities for the middle 2 numbers, or the 3rd and 4th smallest numbers? The average of these 2 numbers must be 6, or the sum must be 2 ? 6 = 12.* What must be the sum of the remaining 4 numbers?  The mean of all 6 numbers is 7, so their sum is 6 ? 7 = 42. The sum of the middle 2 numbers is 12, so the sum of the remaining 4 numbers must be 42 ? 12 = 30.* Next, let’s consider the cases for the 2 middle numbers that result in a sum of 12. The following possibilities exist:* Case 1: 3rd smallest number: 6, 4th smallest number 6. This is not possible because the numbers are distinct.* Case 2: 3rd smallest number: 4, 4th smallest number 8. In this case, there are very few possibilities for the lowest 2 numbers. Since they must be positive, less than 4, and distinct, the only possibilities are (1,2), (1,3), and (2,3). In addition, the range must also be 9. Therefore, the largest number will be the lowest number plus the range, which can be 1+9 = 10 or 2+9 = 11. We can consider each of the cases for the largest and smallest numbers, however, we should first check if this case is even possible.* Is it possible for the sum of the 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 6th smallest numbers to be 30 in this case?  We can consider each of the cases for the largest and smallest numbers, however, we should first check if having a mean of 7 is even possible. The largest number can be at most 11, and the 2nd largest number can be at most 10 since it can’t be the same as the largest number. This means the sum of these 4 numbers can be at most 2+3+10+11 = 26, which isn’t large enough to be 30. Therefore, this case doesn’t work.* Case 3: 3rd smallest number: 3, 4th smallest number 9. The smallest 2 numbers must be 1 and 2, since all of the numbers must be positive and less than 3. Then, by similar logic to the previous case, the largest value is 1+9 = 10. The 2nd largest value can be at most 9. This means the sum is at most 1+2+9+10 = 22, which is again, not large enough.* Case 4: 3rd smallest number 2 or 1, 4th smallest number 10 or 11, respectively. For the other cases, the 3rd smallest number will be less than 3. However, we must have 2 distinct positive values less than the 3rd smallest number (the 1st and 2nd smallest numbers). We can see that if the 3rd smallest value is less than 3 and is 1 or 2, then there are 0 or 1 distinct positive values less than this number. Therefore, these cases don’t work. * Case 5: 3rd smallest number: 5, 4th smallest number 7. Is it possible for the smallest number to be 2? Let’s see if it’s possible for the sum of smallest 2 numbers and largest 2 numbers to be 30 in this case. The largest possible value for the 2nd smallest number is 4, since it has to be less than 5. The largest number must be the smallest number plus the range, which is 2+9 = 11, and the 2nd largest number can be at most 10. Therefore, sum of smallest 2 numbers and largest 2 numbers is at most 2+4+10+11 = 27. Therefore, the smallest number cannot be 2.* If the smallest number is 1, the sum will be even lower since the largest will be 10, and the 2nd largest number will be at most 9. This would result in a sum even lower than in the previous possibility. Therefore, the smallest number must be 3, and since the 2nd smallest number has to be greater than the smallest number (3) and less than the 3rd smallest number (5), it must be 4. In addition, the largest number will be 3+9=12. Then, let the 2nd largest number be x.* What value of x will result in the sum smallest 2 numbers and largest 2 numbers being 30?  Adding all of these numbers, we get that this sum is 3+4+12+x=30. This means that the 2nd largest number is 11. This case works because this number is smaller than the largest number (12), and larger than the 4th smallest number (7).* The 6 numbers (in increasing order) are 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, 12 satisfy all 3 conditions. The sum of the 2nd and 5th smallest numbers are 4+11 = 15.
