Primes are numbers that have exactly two factors: 1 and the number itself. Example: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 are all primes* Note: 1 is not a prime and 2 is the only even prime.* To check whether a number n is prime, we need to check whether it can be* divided by all the primes that are less than or equal to √nDivisibility RulesHere are some important rules to figure out whether a number is divisible by another number.* Divisibility rule for 2: Last digit is even. o Example: 362, the last digit is even, so 362 is divisible by 2.* Divisibility rule for 3: Sum of digits is divisible by 3o Example: 972, the sum of digits is 9 + 7 + 2 = 18, which is a multiple of 3* Divisibility rule for 4: The number formed by the last 2 digits is divisible by 4o Example: 172947, the number formed by last two digits is 47 which is not divisible by 4, so 172947 is also not divisible by 4o Example: 10764, the number formed by last two digits is 64 which is divisible by 4, so 10764 is divisible by 4* Divisibility rule for 5 - Last digit is 0 or 5o Example: 375. The last digit is 5, so 375 is divisible by 5.o Example: 140. The last digit is 0, so 140 is divisible by 5.* Divisibility rule for 6: The number is divisible by both 2 and 3o Example: 196. The last digit is 2, so 196 is divisible by 2. The sum of digits is 1 + 9 + 6 = 16, which is not a multiple of 3, so 196 is not a multiple of 3. Therefore, 196 is also not a multiple of 6.o Example: 252. The last digit is 2, so 252 is divisible by 2. The sum of digits is 2 + 5 + 2 = 9, which is a multiple of 3, so 196 is a multiple of 3. Therefore, 196 is also a multiple of 6.* Divisibility rule for 7: Take out factors of 7 until you reach a small number that is either divisible or not divisible by 7o Example: 2240. We subtract 2100, which is divisible by 7 (7 ? 300) to get 2240 - 2100 = 140. Then, we see that 140 is also divisible by 7 as it is 7 ? 20. Therefore, 2240 is also divisible by 7.o Example: 28146. We subtract 28000, which is divisible by 7 (7 ? 4000) to get 28146 - 28000 = 146. Then, we subtract 140 as it is also divisible by 7 to get 6. 6 is clearly not divisible by 7, so 28146 is also not divisible by 7.* Divisibility rule for 8: The number formed by the last 3 digits is divisible by 8.o Example: 423824. The number formed by the last 3 digits is 824 which is divisible by 8 (8 ? 103), so 423824 is also divisible by 8.o Example: 4827676 The last 3 digits are 676. Using the same technique that we used to find numbers divisible by 7, we can subtract off numbers divisible by 8. Clearly, 640 is divisible by 8 (8 ? 80), so subtracting that off, we get 676? 640 = 36. Then, we can subtract off 8 ? 4 = 32 to get 4. We know that 4 is not divisible by 8. Therefore, 4827676 is also not divisible by 8.* Divisibility rule for 9: Sum of digits is divisible by 9.o Example: 63198. The sum of digits is 6+3+1+9+8 = 27, which is divisible by 9, so 63198 is also divisible by 9. Example: 815419 The sum of digits is 8 + 1 + 5 + 4 + 1 + 9 = 28, which is not divisible by 9, so 63198 is not divisible by 9.* Divisibility rule for 10 - Last digit is 0o Example: 331960. The last digit is 0, so 331960 is divisible by 10.* Divisibility rule for 11: Calculate the sum of odd positioned digits (O) and even positioned digits (E). If O - E is divisible by 11, then the number is also divisible by 11. Don’t forget that O - E can be negative.o Example: 1331 First, we calculate the sum of the odd positioned digits, or the sum of the 1st and 3rd digits from the left. We find O = 1 + 3 = 4. Next, we calculate the sum of the even positioned digits, or the sum of the 2nd and 4th digits from the left. We find E = 3 + 1 = 4. The difference of numbers, O? E = 4? 4 = 0, and 0 is a multiple of 11, so 1331 is divisible by 11.* Divisibility rule for 12: Divisible by 3 and 4o Example: 1584. First, we check if 1584 is divisible by 3. The sum of digits is 1 + 5 + 8 + 4 = 18, which is divisible by 3, so 1584 is divisible by 3. Next, we check if 1584 is divisible by 4. The last 2 digits, 84, is divisible by 4, so 1584 is also divisible by 4. Therefore, 1584 is divisible by 12 since it is divisible by both 3 and 4.* Divisibility rule for 15: Divisible by 3 and 5o Example: 352305. First, we check if 352305 is divisible by 3. The sum of digits is 3 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 5 = 18, which is divisible by 3, so 352305 is not divisible by 3. Next, we check if 352305 is divisible by 5. The last digits, 5, is divisible by 5, so 235305 is also divisible by 5. Therefore, 352305 is divisible by 15 since it is divisible by both 3 and 5.Q1 - Find the prime factorization of 117.A1 - First, let’s check if 117 is divisible by any small primes. * Clearly, 117 is odd and not divisible by 2.* Is 117 divisible by 3? We can see that since the sum of digits is 9, a multiple of 3, the number is divisible by 3. * In fact, since 9 is also a multiple of 9, the number is also divisible by 9 or 3^2. Dividing by 3^2 we get 117/9 = 13. Clearly, 13 is prime. Therefore, our prime factorization is 32 ? 13.Q2 - The 3-digit number A3B is divisible by 15. What is the sum of all such possible numbers?A2 - We can use our knowledge of divisibility rules to solve this.* For a number to be divisible by 15, what other numbers must it be divisible by? Since 15 is the product of 3 and 5, a number divisible by 15 must also be divisible by both 3 and 5. To solve this problem, we need to check the divisibility rules for 3 and 5.* Which divisibility rule should we look at first? If we look at the rule for divisibility by 3 first, we will end up with many possibilities for A and B.* On the other hand, what does the divisibility rule for 5 tell us? The divisibility rule for 5 tells us that B must be either 0 or 5. This simplifies the process, as we only need to consider two possibilities for B. Since we’ve already checked for divisibility by 5, we now need to check for divisibility by 3.* Case 1: B = 0. If B is 0, then the number will be A30. For this number to be divisible by 3, A + 3 + 0 (or A + 3) must be divisible by 3. Since 3 is already a multiple of 3, A also needs to be a multiple of 3. This means A can be 3, 6, or 9, as it has to be a 3-digit number. This gives the possible numbers: 330, 630, and 930.* Case 2: B = 5. If B is 5, then the number will be A35. For this number to be divisible by 3, A + 3 + 5 (or A + 8) must be divisible by 3. Since 8 leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, A must leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3 to make the sum divisible by 3. This means A can be 1, 4, or 7. This gives the possible numbers: 135, 435, and 735.* Summing all numbers, we get: 330 + 630 + 930 + 135 + 435 + 735 = 3195Q3 - The number 3AB76 is divisible by 264, where A and B are digits. Find A + B.A3 - For a number to be divisible by 264, what other numbers must it be divisible by? To figure this out, we first find the prime factorization of 264.* First, we divide out by powers of 2. Doing this repeatedly, we get 264 = 2 x 132 = 2? x 66 = 2? x 33. Then, we can notice that the sum of digits of 33 is 3 + 3 = 6, which is a multiple of 3, so 33 is a multiple of 3. Dividing by 3, we are then left with 11, which is clearly a prime number.* Therefore, the prime factorization is 2? x 3 x 11. Therefore, for the number to be divisible by 264, it must be divisible by 2? (= 8), 3, and 11.* First, what information does 3AB76 being divisible by 8 give us? By the divisibility rule for 8, the last 3 digits, or B76, must be divisible by 8. Notice that 76 leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8. Therefore, B = 0 doesn't work.* When B is 1, then we are adding 100 to the last 3 digits. 100 also leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8. So 176 = 176 + 100 will leave a remainder of 4 + 4 = 8 or 0 when divided by 8, so 176 is divisible by 8.* Next, we can see that when B is 2, our number will be 276, which is equal to 100 + 176. Since 176 is divisible by 8 and 100 leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8, 276 will leave a remainder of 0 + 4 = 4 when divided by 8.* Do you notice a pattern with the remainders here? Whenever B is even, it appears that B76 leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8, and whenever B is odd, B76 is divisible by 8. This is because 176 is divisible by 8, adding 100 will make the remainder 4 when divided by 8. Therefore, by adding 200, the remainder will become 4 + 4 = 8 or 0. Therefore, only odd values of B work.* Next, what does 3AB76 being divisible by 11 tell us? Using the divisibility rule for 11, we have that the sum of the odd positioned digits, O = 3 + B + 6 = 9 + B and the sum of the even positioned digits, E = A + 7. Therefore, O - E = 2 + B - A must be divisible by 11.* What are the possible values for O - E = 2 + B - A? Let's suppose it is equal to -11. Then 2 + B - A = -11 which means A - B = 13. Since A and B are digits from 0 to 9, this is clearly impossible. Any other negative multiple of 11 such as -22, -33, etc. will also mean that A - B equals something larger than 9.* Next, let's suppose it is equal to 0. Then 2 + B - A = 0 which means A - B = 2. Since we have that B is odd from it being a multiple of 8, the only possibilities are: o A = 3, B = 1o A = 5, B = 3o A = 7, B = 5o A = 9, B = 7* If B = 9, then A = 11, which is not possible as A needs to be 1 digit. Finally, let's suppose O - E is equal to 11. Then 2 + B - A = 11 which means B - A = 9. Because A and B are digits from 0 to 9, the only possibility is when A = 0 and B = 9. Any other positive multiple of 11 such as 22, 33, etc. will mean that B - A equals something larger than 9.* How do we use the fact that 3AB76 is a multiple of 3 to finish the problem? Notice how we only have 5 cases, so we can easily manually check if each one is a multiple of 3 by using its divisibility rule.* Case 1: A = 3, B = 1. For this case, the number is 33176. The sum of digits is 3 + 3 + 1 + 7 + 6 = 20, which is not a multiple of 3, so this case does not work.* Case 2: A = 5, B = 3. For this case, the number is 35376. The sum of digits is 3 + 5 + 3 + 7 + 6 = 24, which is a multiple of 3, so this case does work.* Case 3: A = 7, B = 5. For this case, the number is 37576. The sum of digits is 3 + 7 + 5 + 7 + 6 = 28, which is not a multiple of 3, so this case does not work.* Case 4: A = 9, B = 7. For this case, the number is 39776. The sum of digits is 3 + 9 + 7 + 7 + 6 = 32, which is not a multiple of 3, so this case does not work.* Case 5: A = 0, B = 9. For this case, the number is 30976. The sum of digits is 3 + 0 + 9 + 7 + 6 = 25, which is not a multiple of 3, so this case does not work.* Therefore, A = 5 and B = 3 is the only case that works, so our answer is 5 + 3 = 8.Q4 - How many factors does the number 112 have?A4 - To find how many factors 112 has, we must find the prime factorization of 112.* Clearly, 112 is divisible by 2. We can repeatedly divide by 2 to get: 112 = 2 x 56 = 2? x 28 = 2? x 14 = 2? x 7* Since 7 is prime, there are no further primes to divide, so the prime factorization is 2? x 7?. From this, how do we find the number of factors of 112?* We can simply use the formula shown above to find the number of factors. In the prime factorization, the exponents are 4 and 1. Adding 1 to each of the exponents, we get 5 and 2. Therefore, the number of factors is 5 x 2 = 10.Q5 - How many positive factors does the number 144 have that are perfect squares?A5 - First, we begin by finding the prime factorization of 144. We first divide by factors of 2. This gives us 144 = 2? x 72 = 2? x 36 = 2? x 18 = 2? x 9. 9 is simply 3?, so our prime factorization is 2? x 3?. Unlike the last problem, we can’t just directly apply the number of factors formula.* How can we deal with the condition that the factor must be a perfect square? For a number to be a perfect square, all primes in the prime factorization must be even. Let’s try to find the number of exponents possible for each prime to form a perfect square factor.* How many choices are there for the exponent of the prime 2 in the prime factorization? For the number to be a square, the exponent must be even and between 0 to 4. It can be either 0, 2, or 4. Therefore, we have 3 choices.* How many choices are there for the exponent of the prime 3 in the prime factorization? Similarly, the exponent for 3 must be even and from 0 to 2, so it can be either 0, or 2. Therefore, we have 2 choices.* Therefore, in total, 144 has 3 x 2 = 6 perfect square factors.Q6 - What is the sum of factors of 112?A6 - We can calculate that the prime factorization of 112 = 24 ? 7. We will find the sum of powers of 2 and powers of 7.* What is the sum of powers of 2? The exponent of 2 can be anything from 0 to 4. Therefore, the sum of powers of 2 is 20 + 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 = 31.* Similarly, the sum of powers of 7 is 70 + 71 = 8. Therefore, the sum of factors of 112 will be the product of both of our sums, which is 31 ? 8 = 248.Q7 - Find the product of the factors of 20.A7 - First, we must find the number of factors of 20, as this is needed in the formula. To do this,we must first find the prime factorization of 20.* We first divide by powers of 2. We have that 20 = 21 ? 10 = 22 ? 5 = 22 ? 51. Since 5 is prime, this is the prime factorization of 20. * From here, how many factors does 20 have? We simply add 1 to each exponent to get 3 and 2. The number of factors will be the product, which is 3 ? 2 = 6.* Then, we must apply the formula to get the product of factors. From above, we have 233 Factors that the number of factors f = 6. * Also, we have that the number n = 20. Plugging this into the formula, we get 20^(6/2) = 20^3 = 8000Q8 - Suppose we have 2 numbers m and n such that mn = 1260 and LCM (m, n) = 210. FindGCD(m, n).A8 -  We know the product and lcm of the numbers, we can use the identity thatgcd(m, n) ? lcm(m, n) = m ? n. Then, we can simply plug in the given values to get gcd(m, n) ? 210 = 1260. Dividing bothsides by 210 gives gcd(m, n) = 6.Q9 - Find the GCD of 186 and 92.A9 -  We can apply the Euclidean Algorithm multiple times to easily find the GCD of large numbers since after applying the Euclidean algorithm, we will have two smaller numbers, and we can repeatedly apply the Euclidean Algorithm again until we get two very small numbers.* gcd(186, 92) = gcd((186? (2· 92)), 92)* gcd(2, 92)* gcd(2, (92? (2· 46)))* gcd(2, 0)* 2Q10 - 3 numbers a, b, and c satisfy the conditions that gcd(a, b) = 4, gcd(b, c) = 18, andlcm(a, c) = 144. Find the value of a + c.A10 - To solve this problem, let’s first figure out how to use the gcd conditions.* What must be true about a and b if gcd(a, b) = 4? If gcd(a, b) = 4, then both a and b must be multiples of 4. Similarly, if gcd(b, c) = 18, then both b and c must be multiples of 18.* What do both of these conditions combined tell us about b? If b is a multiple of 4 and a multiple of 18, it also must be a multiple of the least common multiple of 4 and 18 by the above theorem. This means b is a multiple of 36. The reason this is true is because to be a multiple of 18, it must also be as multiple of 9 and 2. However, a number that is a multiple of 4 is already a multiple of 2, so therefore it just has to be a multiple of 9 ? 4 = 36.* We know that a must be a multiple of 4. What happens if a is also a multiple of 3, or even 9? Keep in mind that gcd(a, b) = 4 means that not only both numbers share a factor of 4, but that no other factors are shared between the numbers. From earlier, we know that b is a multiple of 36. Therefore, if a has any factors of 3, then the gcd will also have factors of 3 since both a and b would then have factors of 3. Therefore, a cannot have any factors of 3.* Similarly, what must be true about c? We know c is a multiple of 18, which means it’s a multiple of 9 and a multiple of 2. On the other hand, b is a multiple of 36. The gcd is 18, so if c is a multiple of 36, then the gcd would have been 36, which is not possible. Therefore, c cannot be a multiple of 36. We already know c is a multiple of 9, that means c is not a multiple of 4. * Finally, how do we use the condition that lcm(a, c) = 144? First, let’s find the prime factorization of 144. First, we divide by factors of 2 to get 144 = 2 ? 72 = 2^2 ? 36 = 2^3 ? 18 = 2^4 ? 9. 9 is 3^2, so the prime factorization is 2^4 ? 3^2* For lcm(a, c) to have a factor of 24, how many factors of 2 must a and c each have? Remember from earlier that c is a multiple of 2, but not a multiple of 4. Therefore, c has 1 factor of 2. However, for the lcm to have a factor of 24, one of the numbers a or c must have exactly 4 powers of 2 in the prime factorization since the lcm is found by taking the maximum powers of each prime in the prime factorization of both numbers. Therefore, a must have exactly 4 powers of 2. It can’t be more than 4 powers of 2 because then the lcm would also have more than 4 powers of 2. Also, c is a multiple of 2, but not 4, it will have exactly 1 power of 2 in it’s prime factorization.* Next, for lcm(a, c) to have a factor of 32, how many factors of 3 must a and c each have? Earlier, we found that a has no factors of 3 and c must be a multiple of 9. Therefore, c must have exactly 2 powers of 3 in it’s prime factorization. Again, it can’t have any more than 2 powers of 3 since that would result in lcm also having more than 2 powers of 3.* Finally, can either a or c have any other prime factors besides 2 or 3? If a or c had a factor of 5, 7, or some other prime, then the lcm would also have that prime in it’s prime factorization. But earlier, we found that the prime factorization 24 ? 32 only contains factors of 2 and 3. Therefore, this is impossible.* What are the values of a and c that work? Since a has 4 powers of 2, no powers of 3, and no powers of any other prime, the prime factorization is 24. Therefore, a = 16.* Similarly, since b has 1 power of 2, 2 powers of 3, and no powers of any other prime, the prime factorization is 2 ? 32. Therefore, b = 18. The sum is therefore 16 + 18 = 34.A11 - The identity above allows us to simply find each term (mod 1000) and multiply them together. We can clearly see that 9 ? 9 (mod 1000) and 99 ? 99 (mod 1000). What is the value of 999 (mod 1000)?A11 -  Since 999 is 1 less than 1000, 999 ? ?1 (mod 1000).* What is the value of 9999 (mod 1000)? Notice that 9999 is again 1 less than a multiple of 1000 (10,000), so 9999 ? ?1 (mod 1000). For all remaining terms, we can see that since it ends in 999, it will be 1 less than a multiple of 1000 or ?1 (mod 1000).* In total, amongst all 999 terms, 1 term is 9 (mod 1000), 1 term is 99 (mod 1000), and the 997 remaining terms are all?1 (mod 1000).* Therefore, the product will be 9?99?(?1)997 (mod 1000) ? 891??1?(?1)996 ? ?891?((?1)2)498 ? ?891?1 ? 109 (mod 1000)
