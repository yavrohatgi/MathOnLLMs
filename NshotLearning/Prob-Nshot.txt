Probability is the likelihood of something happening. To calculate probability, you need to know how many possible options or outcomes there are and how many right combinations there are.
Probability = Total number of desired outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes

Q1 - What is the probability of rolling a prime number on a 6-sided dice?
A1 - To calculate probability, we need to find the number of successful and total outcomes.
* How many successful outcomes are there? We can see that there are 3 prime numbers from 1 to 6 (2, 3 and 5).
* Next, how many total outcomes are there? Well, this is just 6 because it can be any number from 1 to 6.
* Therefore, since the probability is just the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 . 

Q2 -  I have cards numbered from 1 to 10. What is the probability I pick a pair of 2 different
cards that have an odd product?
A2 - This is a rather simple example however it demonstrates an important point about distinguishability in probability problems.
* What must happen for the cards to have an odd product? Both cards must be odd.
* How many pairs of cards have both cards odd? If order does not matter, then there are 5 x 2 = 10 combinations. However, if the order does matter, then there are 5 ? 4 = 20 permutations.
* How many total pairs of cards can be chosen? If order does not matter, then there are 10 x 2 = 45 combinations. However, if the order does matter, then there are 10 ? 9 = 90 permutations.
* So does the order matter of the cards in the pair matter or not? If the order of the cards in the pair does matter, then the probability is 20/90 = 2/9
* If the order of the cards does not matter, then the probability is 10/45 = 2/9
* Why are the probabilities are the same? When dealing with ordered pairs, the number of successful and total pairs were multiplied by 2! so they would cancel out when dividing!

Q3 - The sum of 2 positive integers is 4. Find the probability that one of the integers is a 2.
A3 - There are 2 cases where both integers are 2 or where one integer is a 3 and the other is a 1.
* So, is the probability just 1/2 ? No! While there are only 2 cases, they both have different chances of happening.
* How many ways are there for each case to happen? There is only 1 way where both integers can be 2 
* However, there are 2 ways one of the integers is a 1 and the other is a 3 as we can flip them. The 2nd case is more likely.
* What is the probability with this knowledge? There are a total of 3 cases of which 1 satisfies the condition so the probability is 1/3. 


Q4 - Sohil randomly picks a number from 1 to 10. Sejal randomly picks a number from 1 to 25. What is the probability that the product of the numbers they choose is odd?
A4 -  For this problem, although it is possible to find the number of successful and total outcomes amongst both picks of numbers, there is an easier way to solve the problem.
* To start, what do we know about 2 numbers whose product is odd? For the product of 2 numbers to be odd, both numbers must be odd because if any of the numbers are even, then the product will also have a factor of 2 in it.
* Next, how can find the probability that Sohil and Sejal pick odd numbers? We could find  the number of successful and total outcomes amongst both picks of numbers as mentioned earlier, but instead, we can simply find the probabilities of each of them picking an odd number. The probability of Sohil picking an odd number is 5/10 = «
* The probability of Sejal picking an odd number is 13/ 25 since there are 13 odd numbers from 1 to 25.
* Now, how do we find the overall probability of both of them picking an odd number? We must multiply the probabilities. Therefore, the overall probability is 1/2 * 13/25 = 13/50. 

Q5 - Alex, Betty, Chase, Derek, Emma, Fiona, and George are racing in a marathon. If they
finish in a random order, what is the probability that Chase is 1st and George is 6th?
A5 - Let?s see how to solve this problem with dependent events. 
* Can we just use the technique above to solve this problem? That won?t work because this time, Chase? rank affects George?s rank, such as in the case where Chase is 6th which would make it impossible for George to be 6th, so the events affect each other.
* Then, how do we approach this question? To do this, let?s first consider the probability Chase is 1st and then find the probability George is 6th given that Chase is 1st.
* What is the probability that Chase is selected first? Because there are 7 people who can be first and Chase is one of those persons, the probability is simply 1/7 since they finish in a random order.
* Next, what is the probability that George is selected 6th if Chase is first? Notice that now out of the 7 original positions, only 6 are left. Therefore, since all positions are equally likely for George, the probability he is 6th is 1/6.
* Now, how do we find the overall probability? Notice that we only need to find the probability that both Chase is first and George is 6th. Therefore, we can just find the probability of Chase being first and multiply that by the probability that George is 6th. Therefore, our answer is just 1/6 * 1/7 = 1/42.
