Primes are numbers that have exactly two factors: 1 and the number itself. Example: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 are all primes* Note: 1 is not a prime and 2 is the only even prime.* To check whether a number n is prime, we need to check whether it can be* divided by all the primes that are less than or equal to √nDivisibility RulesHere are some important rules to figure out whether a number is divisible by another number.* Divisibility rule for 2: Last digit is even. o Example: 362, the last digit is even, so 362 is divisible by 2.* Divisibility rule for 3: Sum of digits is divisible by 3o Example: 972, the sum of digits is 9 + 7 + 2 = 18, which is a multiple of 3* Divisibility rule for 4: The number formed by the last 2 digits is divisible by 4o Example: 172947, the number formed by last two digits is 47 which is not divisible by 4, so 172947 is also not divisible by 4o Example: 10764, the number formed by last two digits is 64 which is divisible by 4, so 10764 is divisible by 4* Divisibility rule for 5 - Last digit is 0 or 5o Example: 375. The last digit is 5, so 375 is divisible by 5.o Example: 140. The last digit is 0, so 140 is divisible by 5.* Divisibility rule for 6: The number is divisible by both 2 and 3o Example: 196. The last digit is 2, so 196 is divisible by 2. The sum of digits is 1 + 9 + 6 = 16, which is not a multiple of 3, so 196 is not a multiple of 3. Therefore, 196 is also not a multiple of 6.o Example: 252. The last digit is 2, so 252 is divisible by 2. The sum of digits is 2 + 5 + 2 = 9, which is a multiple of 3, so 196 is a multiple of 3. Therefore, 196 is also a multiple of 6.* Divisibility rule for 7: Take out factors of 7 until you reach a small number that is either divisible or not divisible by 7o Example: 2240. We subtract 2100, which is divisible by 7 (7 ? 300) to get 2240 - 2100 = 140. Then, we see that 140 is also divisible by 7 as it is 7 ? 20. Therefore, 2240 is also divisible by 7.o Example: 28146. We subtract 28000, which is divisible by 7 (7 ? 4000) to get 28146 - 28000 = 146. Then, we subtract 140 as it is also divisible by 7 to get 6. 6 is clearly not divisible by 7, so 28146 is also not divisible by 7.* Divisibility rule for 8: The number formed by the last 3 digits is divisible by 8.o Example: 423824. The number formed by the last 3 digits is 824 which is divisible by 8 (8 ? 103), so 423824 is also divisible by 8.o Example: 4827676 The last 3 digits are 676. Using the same technique that we used to find numbers divisible by 7, we can subtract off numbers divisible by 8. Clearly, 640 is divisible by 8 (8 ? 80), so subtracting that off, we get 676? 640 = 36. Then, we can subtract off 8 ? 4 = 32 to get 4. We know that 4 is not divisible by 8. Therefore, 4827676 is also not divisible by 8.* Divisibility rule for 9: Sum of digits is divisible by 9.o Example: 63198. The sum of digits is 6+3+1+9+8 = 27, which is divisible by 9, so 63198 is also divisible by 9. Example: 815419 The sum of digits is 8 + 1 + 5 + 4 + 1 + 9 = 28, which is not divisible by 9, so 63198 is not divisible by 9.* Divisibility rule for 10 - Last digit is 0o Example: 331960. The last digit is 0, so 331960 is divisible by 10.* Divisibility rule for 11: Calculate the sum of odd positioned digits (O) and even positioned digits (E). If O - E is divisible by 11, then the number is also divisible by 11. Don’t forget that O - E can be negative.o Example: 1331 First, we calculate the sum of the odd positioned digits, or the sum of the 1st and 3rd digits from the left. We find O = 1 + 3 = 4. Next, we calculate the sum of the even positioned digits, or the sum of the 2nd and 4th digits from the left. We find E = 3 + 1 = 4. The difference of numbers, O? E = 4? 4 = 0, and 0 is a multiple of 11, so 1331 is divisible by 11.* Divisibility rule for 12: Divisible by 3 and 4o Example: 1584. First, we check if 1584 is divisible by 3. The sum of digits is 1 + 5 + 8 + 4 = 18, which is divisible by 3, so 1584 is divisible by 3. Next, we check if 1584 is divisible by 4. The last 2 digits, 84, is divisible by 4, so 1584 is also divisible by 4. Therefore, 1584 is divisible by 12 since it is divisible by both 3 and 4.* Divisibility rule for 15: Divisible by 3 and 5o Example: 352305. First, we check if 352305 is divisible by 3. The sum of digits is 3 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 5 = 18, which is divisible by 3, so 352305 is not divisible by 3. Next, we check if 352305 is divisible by 5. The last digits, 5, is divisible by 5, so 235305 is also divisible by 5. Therefore, 352305 is divisible by 15 since it is divisible by both 3 and 5.Q1 - Find the prime factorization of 117.A1 - First, let’s check if 117 is divisible by any small primes. * Clearly, 117 is odd and not divisible by 2.* Is 117 divisible by 3? We can see that since the sum of digits is 9, a multiple of 3, the number is divisible by 3. * In fact, since 9 is also a multiple of 9, the number is also divisible by 9 or 3^2. Dividing by 3^2 we get 117/9 = 13. Clearly, 13 is prime. Therefore, our prime factorization is 32 ? 13.Q2 - The 3-digit number A3B is divisible by 15. What is the sum of all such possible numbers?A2 - We can use our knowledge of divisibility rules to solve this.* For a number to be divisible by 15, what other numbers must it be divisible by? Since 15 is the product of 3 and 5, a number divisible by 15 must also be divisible by both 3 and 5. To solve this problem, we need to check the divisibility rules for 3 and 5.* Which divisibility rule should we look at first? If we look at the rule for divisibility by 3 first, we will end up with many possibilities for A and B.* On the other hand, what does the divisibility rule for 5 tell us? The divisibility rule for 5 tells us that B must be either 0 or 5. This simplifies the process, as we only need to consider two possibilities for B. Since we’ve already checked for divisibility by 5, we now need to check for divisibility by 3.* Case 1: B = 0. If B is 0, then the number will be A30. For this number to be divisible by 3, A + 3 + 0 (or A + 3) must be divisible by 3. Since 3 is already a multiple of 3, A also needs to be a multiple of 3. This means A can be 3, 6, or 9, as it has to be a 3-digit number. This gives the possible numbers: 330, 630, and 930.* Case 2: B = 5. If B is 5, then the number will be A35. For this number to be divisible by 3, A + 3 + 5 (or A + 8) must be divisible by 3. Since 8 leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, A must leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3 to make the sum divisible by 3. This means A can be 1, 4, or 7. This gives the possible numbers: 135, 435, and 735.* Summing all numbers, we get: 330 + 630 + 930 + 135 + 435 + 735 = 3195Q3 - The number 3AB76 is divisible by 264, where A and B are digits. Find A + B.A3 - For a number to be divisible by 264, what other numbers must it be divisible by? To figure this out, we first find the prime factorization of 264.* First, we divide out by powers of 2. Doing this repeatedly, we get 264 = 2 x 132 = 2? x 66 = 2? x 33. Then, we can notice that the sum of digits of 33 is 3 + 3 = 6, which is a multiple of 3, so 33 is a multiple of 3. Dividing by 3, we are then left with 11, which is clearly a prime number.* Therefore, the prime factorization is 2? x 3 x 11. Therefore, for the number to be divisible by 264, it must be divisible by 2? (= 8), 3, and 11.* First, what information does 3AB76 being divisible by 8 give us? By the divisibility rule for 8, the last 3 digits, or B76, must be divisible by 8. Notice that 76 leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8. Therefore, B = 0 doesn't work.* When B is 1, then we are adding 100 to the last 3 digits. 100 also leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8. So 176 = 176 + 100 will leave a remainder of 4 + 4 = 8 or 0 when divided by 8, so 176 is divisible by 8.* Next, we can see that when B is 2, our number will be 276, which is equal to 100 + 176. Since 176 is divisible by 8 and 100 leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8, 276 will leave a remainder of 0 + 4 = 4 when divided by 8.* Do you notice a pattern with the remainders here? Whenever B is even, it appears that B76 leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8, and whenever B is odd, B76 is divisible by 8. This is because 176 is divisible by 8, adding 100 will make the remainder 4 when divided by 8. Therefore, by adding 200, the remainder will become 4 + 4 = 8 or 0. Therefore, only odd values of B work.* Next, what does 3AB76 being divisible by 11 tell us? Using the divisibility rule for 11, we have that the sum of the odd positioned digits, O = 3 + B + 6 = 9 + B and the sum of the even positioned digits, E = A + 7. Therefore, O - E = 2 + B - A must be divisible by 11.* What are the possible values for O - E = 2 + B - A? Let's suppose it is equal to -11. Then 2 + B - A = -11 which means A - B = 13. Since A and B are digits from 0 to 9, this is clearly impossible. Any other negative multiple of 11 such as -22, -33, etc. will also mean that A - B equals something larger than 9.* Next, let's suppose it is equal to 0. Then 2 + B - A = 0 which means A - B = 2. Since we have that B is odd from it being a multiple of 8, the only possibilities are: o A = 3, B = 1o A = 5, B = 3o A = 7, B = 5o A = 9, B = 7* If B = 9, then A = 11, which is not possible as A needs to be 1 digit. Finally, let's suppose O - E is equal to 11. Then 2 + B - A = 11 which means B - A = 9. Because A and B are digits from 0 to 9, the only possibility is when A = 0 and B = 9. Any other positive multiple of 11 such as 22, 33, etc. will mean that B - A equals something larger than 9.* How do we use the fact that 3AB76 is a multiple of 3 to finish the problem? Notice how we only have 5 cases, so we can easily manually check if each one is a multiple of 3 by using its divisibility rule.* Case 1: A = 3, B = 1. For this case, the number is 33176. The sum of digits is 3 + 3 + 1 + 7 + 6 = 20, which is not a multiple of 3, so this case does not work.* Case 2: A = 5, B = 3. For this case, the number is 35376. The sum of digits is 3 + 5 + 3 + 7 + 6 = 24, which is a multiple of 3, so this case does work.* Case 3: A = 7, B = 5. For this case, the number is 37576. The sum of digits is 3 + 7 + 5 + 7 + 6 = 28, which is not a multiple of 3, so this case does not work.* Case 4: A = 9, B = 7. For this case, the number is 39776. The sum of digits is 3 + 9 + 7 + 7 + 6 = 32, which is not a multiple of 3, so this case does not work.* Case 5: A = 0, B = 9. For this case, the number is 30976. The sum of digits is 3 + 0 + 9 + 7 + 6 = 25, which is not a multiple of 3, so this case does not work.* Therefore, A = 5 and B = 3 is the only case that works, so our answer is 5 + 3 = 8.Q4 - How many factors does the number 112 have?A4 - To find how many factors 112 has, we must find the prime factorization of 112.* Clearly, 112 is divisible by 2. We can repeatedly divide by 2 to get: 112 = 2 x 56 = 2? x 28 = 2? x 14 = 2? x 7* Since 7 is prime, there are no further primes to divide, so the prime factorization is 2? x 7?. From this, how do we find the number of factors of 112?* We can simply use the formula shown above to find the number of factors. In the prime factorization, the exponents are 4 and 1. Adding 1 to each of the exponents, we get 5 and 2. Therefore, the number of factors is 5 x 2 = 10.Q5 - How many positive factors does the number 144 have that are perfect squares?A5 - First, we begin by finding the prime factorization of 144. We first divide by factors of 2. This gives us 144 = 2? x 72 = 2? x 36 = 2? x 18 = 2? x 9. 9 is simply 3?, so our prime factorization is 2? x 3?. Unlike the last problem, we can’t just directly apply the number of factors formula.* How can we deal with the condition that the factor must be a perfect square? For a number to be a perfect square, all primes in the prime factorization must be even. Let’s try to find the number of exponents possible for each prime to form a perfect square factor.* How many choices are there for the exponent of the prime 2 in the prime factorization? For the number to be a square, the exponent must be even and between 0 to 4. It can be either 0, 2, or 4. Therefore, we have 3 choices.* How many choices are there for the exponent of the prime 3 in the prime factorization? Similarly, the exponent for 3 must be even and from 0 to 2, so it can be either 0, or 2. Therefore, we have 2 choices.* Therefore, in total, 144 has 3 x 2 = 6 perfect square factors.Q6 - What is the sum of factors of 112?A6 - We can calculate that the prime factorization of 112 = 24 ? 7. We will find the sum of powers of 2 and powers of 7.* What is the sum of powers of 2? The exponent of 2 can be anything from 0 to 4. Therefore, the sum of powers of 2 is 20 + 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 = 31.* Similarly, the sum of powers of 7 is 70 + 71 = 8. Therefore, the sum of factors of 112 will be the product of both of our sums, which is 31 ? 8 = 248.Q7 - Find the product of the factors of 20.A7 - First, we must find the number of factors of 20, as this is needed in the formula. To do this,we must first find the prime factorization of 20.* We first divide by powers of 2. We have that 20 = 21 ? 10 = 22 ? 5 = 22 ? 51. Since 5 is prime, this is the prime factorization of 20. * From here, how many factors does 20 have? We simply add 1 to each exponent to get 3 and 2. The number of factors will be the product, which is 3 ? 2 = 6.* Then, we must apply the formula to get the product of factors. From above, we have 233 Factors that the number of factors f = 6. * Also, we have that the number n = 20. Plugging this into the formula, we get 20^(6/2) = 20^3 = 8000Q8 - Suppose we have 2 numbers m and n such that mn = 1260 and LCM (m, n) = 210. FindGCD(m, n).A8 -  We know the product and lcm of the numbers, we can use the identity thatgcd(m, n) ? lcm(m, n) = m ? n. Then, we can simply plug in the given values to get gcd(m, n) ? 210 = 1260. Dividing bothsides by 210 gives gcd(m, n) = 6.Q9 - Find the GCD of 186 and 92.A9 -  We can apply the Euclidean Algorithm multiple times to easily find the GCD of large numbers since after applying the Euclidean algorithm, we will have two smaller numbers, and we can repeatedly apply the Euclidean Algorithm again until we get two very small numbers.* gcd(186, 92) = gcd((186? (2· 92)), 92)* gcd(2, 92)* gcd(2, (92? (2· 46)))* gcd(2, 0)* 2Q10 - 3 numbers a, b, and c satisfy the conditions that gcd(a, b) = 4, gcd(b, c) = 18, andlcm(a, c) = 144. Find the value of a + c.A10 - To solve this problem, let’s first figure out how to use the gcd conditions.* What must be true about a and b if gcd(a, b) = 4? If gcd(a, b) = 4, then both a and b must be multiples of 4. Similarly, if gcd(b, c) = 18, then both b and c must be multiples of 18.* What do both of these conditions combined tell us about b? If b is a multiple of 4 and a multiple of 18, it also must be a multiple of the least common multiple of 4 and 18 by the above theorem. This means b is a multiple of 36. The reason this is true is because to be a multiple of 18, it must also be as multiple of 9 and 2. However, a number that is a multiple of 4 is already a multiple of 2, so therefore it just has to be a multiple of 9 ? 4 = 36.* We know that a must be a multiple of 4. What happens if a is also a multiple of 3, or even 9? Keep in mind that gcd(a, b) = 4 means that not only both numbers share a factor of 4, but that no other factors are shared between the numbers. From earlier, we know that b is a multiple of 36. Therefore, if a has any factors of 3, then the gcd will also have factors of 3 since both a and b would then have factors of 3. Therefore, a cannot have any factors of 3.* Similarly, what must be true about c? We know c is a multiple of 18, which means it’s a multiple of 9 and a multiple of 2. On the other hand, b is a multiple of 36. The gcd is 18, so if c is a multiple of 36, then the gcd would have been 36, which is not possible. Therefore, c cannot be a multiple of 36. We already know c is a multiple of 9, that means c is not a multiple of 4. * Finally, how do we use the condition that lcm(a, c) = 144? First, let’s find the prime factorization of 144. First, we divide by factors of 2 to get 144 = 2 ? 72 = 2^2 ? 36 = 2^3 ? 18 = 2^4 ? 9. 9 is 3^2, so the prime factorization is 2^4 ? 3^2* For lcm(a, c) to have a factor of 24, how many factors of 2 must a and c each have? Remember from earlier that c is a multiple of 2, but not a multiple of 4. Therefore, c has 1 factor of 2. However, for the lcm to have a factor of 24, one of the numbers a or c must have exactly 4 powers of 2 in the prime factorization since the lcm is found by taking the maximum powers of each prime in the prime factorization of both numbers. Therefore, a must have exactly 4 powers of 2. It can’t be more than 4 powers of 2 because then the lcm would also have more than 4 powers of 2. Also, c is a multiple of 2, but not 4, it will have exactly 1 power of 2 in it’s prime factorization.* Next, for lcm(a, c) to have a factor of 32, how many factors of 3 must a and c each have? Earlier, we found that a has no factors of 3 and c must be a multiple of 9. Therefore, c must have exactly 2 powers of 3 in it’s prime factorization. Again, it can’t have any more than 2 powers of 3 since that would result in lcm also having more than 2 powers of 3.* Finally, can either a or c have any other prime factors besides 2 or 3? If a or c had a factor of 5, 7, or some other prime, then the lcm would also have that prime in it’s prime factorization. But earlier, we found that the prime factorization 24 ? 32 only contains factors of 2 and 3. Therefore, this is impossible.* What are the values of a and c that work? Since a has 4 powers of 2, no powers of 3, and no powers of any other prime, the prime factorization is 24. Therefore, a = 16.* Similarly, since b has 1 power of 2, 2 powers of 3, and no powers of any other prime, the prime factorization is 2 ? 32. Therefore, b = 18. The sum is therefore 16 + 18 = 34.A11 - The identity above allows us to simply find each term (mod 1000) and multiply them together. We can clearly see that 9 ? 9 (mod 1000) and 99 ? 99 (mod 1000). What is the value of 999 (mod 1000)?A11 -  Since 999 is 1 less than 1000, 999 ? ?1 (mod 1000).* What is the value of 9999 (mod 1000)? Notice that 9999 is again 1 less than a multiple of 1000 (10,000), so 9999 ? ?1 (mod 1000). For all remaining terms, we can see that since it ends in 999, it will be 1 less than a multiple of 1000 or ?1 (mod 1000).* In total, amongst all 999 terms, 1 term is 9 (mod 1000), 1 term is 99 (mod 1000), and the 997 remaining terms are all?1 (mod 1000).* Therefore, the product will be 9?99?(?1)997 (mod 1000) ? 891??1?(?1)996 ? ?891?((?1)2)498 ? ?891?1 ? 109 (mod 1000)

Q12 - When 19992000 is divided by 5, what is the remainder?A12 - We can simplify our expression by first evaluating 1999 mod 5.* What mod value is equivalent to 1999 (mod 5)? 1999 leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 5 so we could say that 1999 ? 4 (mod 5).* However, then we would still have to calculate the remainder when 42000 is divided by 5.Instead, what negative mod is equivalent to 1999 (mod 5)* Since 1999 is 1 less than 2000, a multiple of 5, we can say that 1999 ? ?1 (mod 5).* Then, we must find the remainder when?12000 is divided by 5, which is ((?1)2)1000 = 11000 = 1 (mod 5). So it leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 5.Q13 - Find the largest possible number less than 100 that leaves a remainder of 1 when dividedby 5 and a remainder of 1 when divided by 7.A13 - We can rewrite our conditions as x ? 1 (mod 5) and x ? 1 (mod 7). * To solve the problem, we will try to combine these mods in 1 mod statement. If x ? 1 (mod 5) and x ? 1 (mod 7), then what is the value of x? 1 (mod 5) and (mod 7)? Subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation x ? 1 (mod 5) gives us x? 1 ? 0 (mod 5).* Similarly, we get x? 1 ? 0 (mod 7). Therefore, x? 1 is a multiple of both 5 and 7. If x? 1 is a multiple of both 5 and 7, what else must x? 1 be a multiple of?* If x - 1 is a multiple of both 5 and 7, x - 1 will also be a multiple of 5 ? 7 = 35!. Therefore, we have x? 1 ? 0 (mod 35) or x ? 1 (mod 35).* From here, we can see that the possible values less than 100 are 1, 36, 71, 106, etc. Clearly, is the largest possible value less than 100.Q14 - Find the units digit of 21026A14 - 1026 is a very large power, so let’s try to find the units digit for smaller powers.* The units digit of 21 = 2 is 2, the units digit of 22 = 4 is 4, the units digit of 23 = 8 is 8, the units digit of 24 = 16 is 6.* The units digit of 25 = 32 is 2, the units digit of 26 = 64 is 4, the units digit of 27 = 128 is 8, the units digit of 28 = 256 is 6.* Do you see a pattern? We can see that the units digit cycle! In fact, they cycle for every 4 powers of 2 in the pattern 2, 4, 8, 6. After that, the units digit repeat in the same pattern. * How can we use this to find the units digit of 21026? Since it repeats every 4, we have that 21026 ? 21022 ? 21018… (mod 1)0. * We can see that since 1026 is 2 (mod 4), eventually by continuously going down by 4 exponents we will have that 21026 ? 22 ? 4 (mod 1)0. Therefore, the units digit is 4.Q15 - The digits of a 3-digit number are reversed. The original number is 594 greater thanthe new number. What is the largest possible value for the original number?A15 - To start, we will first try and write the problem algebraically. * How can we convert a 3-digit number to variables? Let the hundredths digit be h, the tens digit t, and units digit u (the 3-digit number will be htu). Then, the 3-digit number is essentially 100h + 10t + u.* What is the number in terms of h, t, and u when the digits are reversed? Since the original hundreds digit, h, is now the units digit and the original units digit, u, is now the hundreds digit, the new number will be uth. This is essentially 100u + 10t + h.* Now, how do we use the condition that the original number is 594 greater than the new number? For this to happen, we must have 594 = (100h + 10t + u)? (100u + 10t + h) = (100h? h) + (10t? 10t) + (u? 100h) = 99h? 99u = 99(h? u). Dividing both sides by 99 gives h? u = 6.* What are the possibilities for t? Notice how t is not part of the condition after simplifying, so it can be any digit.* What are the possibilities for h and u? All the digits must be from 0 to 9, so we simply look at the possibilities for h. If h = 9, then u = 3 or If h = 8, then u = 2 or If h = 7, then u = 1 or If h = 6, then u = 0. * These are the only cases because any lower value of h will result in a negative u, which is impossible. * What values of h, u, and t will produce the largest number? Since t can be anything, we can let t = 9 to make it as large as possible. The largest values for h and u is clearly h = 9 and u = 3, since it has the largest hundreds and units digit amongst the cases for h and u. Therefore, the largest possible value for the original number is 100h + 10t + u = 100 ? 9 + 10 ? 9 + 3 = 993.Q16 - Find the sum of all possible distinct values of x + y such that 1/x + 1/y = 1/2A16 - This problem may seem tricky, but there is a simple technique to solve this.* How can we simplify this problem by removing the denominators? Notice that the denominators have values of 2, x, and y, so we can multiply by 2xy to get rid of the fractions. We end up with 2y + 2x = xy.* What identity or formula can we use on this simplified equation? Notice how we have xy, x, and y terms, so we can use Simon’s Favorite Factoring Trick!* We can rewrite our equation as xy? 2x? 2y = 0. We must rewrite the left hand side as something of the form (x + j)(y + k). Remember from the theorem above, the coe?icient of the y term will be j, and the coe?icient of the x term will be k.* Make sure to remember that it’s not the other way around as this can be a common mistake!* Since both coe?icients are -2, j and k must also both be -2. Therefore, we can rewrite as (x? 2)(y? 2).* Are we adding any extra terms? This product also ads an extra (?2) ? (?2) = 4 term. Therefore, we must also subtract the extra 4 we added.* Thus, we have (x? 2)(y? 2)? 4 = 0 or (x? 2)(y? 2) = 4. Since the right hand side is positive, we have 2 possibilities: either x? 2 and y? 2 are both positive, or both are negative.* Is it possible for x? 2 and y? 2 to be negative. Since x and y must be positive integers (1 or more), the minimum value of x? 2 and y? 2 can be 1? 2 =?1.* Therefore, -1 is the only negative value possible for x? 2 and y? 2. However, this will result in the product being?1 ? ?1 = 1, which isn’t 4. So these values don’t work. Therefore, both x? 2 and y? 2 must be positive.* What are the positive possibilities for x? 2 and y? 2? Since their product is 4, they must be factors of 4. Since 4 = 22, the only possibilities for 2 positive numbers that have a product of 4 is (20, 22), (21, 21), and (22, 20) since the sum of the exponents of the powers of 2 must be 2 by the exponent product rule.* We can evaluate this to be (1, 4), (2, 2), and (4, 1). Therefore, we can split the remaining problem into 3 cases:* Case 1: (1, 4) For this case, x? 2 = 1, and y? 2 = 4, so x = 3andy = 6. This means that x + y = 3 + 6 = 9.* Case 2: (2, 2) For this case, x? 2 = 2, and y? 2 = 2, so x = 4andy = 4. This means that x + y = 4 + 4 = 8.* Case 3: (4, 1) For this case, x? 2 = 4, and y? 2 = 1, so x = 6andy = 3. This means that x + y = 6 + 3 = 9.* Therefore, the distinct possible values of x + y are 9 and 8. The sum of these values is 9 + 8 = 17.Q17 - Josh has some quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies worth 101 cents. He has a total of 9 coins, at least 1 of each type of coin, how many nickels and dimes does he have?A17 - First we should try to handle the limiting condition to make the problem simpler.* Is there any way we can easily simplify our problem and remove the condition of must having at least 1 of each coin? We can simply subtract off the value of 1 quarter, 1 dime, 1 nickel, and 1 penny because he must have 1 of each coin anyway.* The total value of these coins is 25 + 10 + 5 + 1 = 41 cents. We are then left with 60 cents to assign to the rest of the coins. Because we have already used 4 coins, the remaining 5 coins must have a value of 60 cents.* Is it possible to have no more quarters? We can see that having no more quarters is impossible because the maximum value for any other coin is 10 cents, so the maximum value of 5 coins would be 50 cents, which is less than 60 cents.* How can we split the remaining possibilities into cases? Since quarter is the coin worth the most, we can split our problem into cases based on how many quarters we will use.* Case 1: 1 more quarter In this case, the quarter will have a value of 25 cents, so the remaining 4 coins have a value of 60? 25 = 35 cents. Clearly, we can see having 4 dimes will not work. However, 3 dimes along with a nickel result in having a total value of 35 cents. Therefore, this case works. Although it’s not necessary, to show that no other cases work, we will look at what happens if we have more quarters.* Case 2: 2 more quarters In this the 2 quarters will have a value of 50 cents, so the remaining 3 coins have a value of 60? 50 = 10 cents. We can clearly see that if we have even 1 dime, it’s impossible for the remaining coins to have a value of 0 cents. Similarly, having 2 nickels is impossible because that means the remaining coin will have a value of 0 cents. Therefore, we can have at most 1 nickel. If we have 1 nickel and the remaining 5 cents worth of coins are pennies, there will be a total of 1 + 5 = 6 coins, which isn’t allowed. If we have no nickels, there will 10 pennies, which also isn’t possible for the same reason.* Case 3: 3 more quarters This is impossible because the total value would be 75 cents, which is above the 60 cents we need. Therefore, the only case is when we have 1 additional quarter, 3 additional dimes, and 1 additional nickel. * Since we also have the include the 1 penny, 1 nickel, 1 dime, and 1 quarter we had in the beginning, there will be 4 dimes and 2 nickels. Therefore, the total number of nickels and dimes is 4 + 2 = 6.Q18 - Sohil has received a new TI-84 Calculator from MATHCOUNTS. He is very excited,so he enters the following expression 26 ? 35 ? 57 into the calculator. On any givenoperation, Sohil will divide the number by it’s largest prime factor, p. Then, he willmultiply the number by p? 1. He continues this process until he reaches a final numberof 1. How many operations, including the final operation, will it take for this to happen?A18 - Let’s analyze this step by step.* To start, what prime number will divide our number first? The largest prime number in the prime factorization is 5, so 5 will divide first. Then, we will have to multiply by 5? 1 = 4 or 22.* After how many operations will all the factors of 5 be gone? Each operation removes 1 power of 5 in the prime factorization, so after 7 operations, in the prime factorization, all the factors of 5 will be gone.* However, we will also have had to multiply by 4 after each operation. How does this change the prime factorization? We will also have had to multiply by 4 = 22, 7 times, or 214. Therefore, after 7 operations, in the prime factorization, we will have 14 additional factors of 2. The prime factorization will therefore be 26 ? 214 ? 35 = 220 ? 35* Now, what prime factor do we have to divide by? The largest prime factor is clearly 3, so we have to divide by this now, instead of 5. Then, we will have to multiply by 3? 1 = 2.* We will need 5 operations to divide by all factors of 3. Doing so, we will also have to multiply the number by 2, 5 times, or by 25. Therefore, after 5 more operations the prime factorization will 220 ? 25 = 225* Now, what prime factor do we have to divide by? Because the only prime factor is 2, we must divide by 2. Doing so, we will also have to multiply our number by 1, which will not change the number. Therefore, because there are 25 factors of 2, we will have to do the operations 25 more times for the number to become 1.* Therefore, the total number of operations needed is 7 + 5 + 25 = 37.
