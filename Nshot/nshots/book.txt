Chapter 1. Permutations
1.1 Permutations Definition
Definition 1.1.1. A permutation is a possible arrangement of objects in a set where the
order of objects matter.
Example 1.1
How many 3-digit passwords are possible where each digit is a number from 0 to 9?
Solution 1.1
This is a permutation since the order of the digits matters! Notice that each digit has 10
choices. F rom this, how do we find the total number of 3-digit passwords?
First, how many 1-digit passwords are there?
This is 10 because the password is simply one of the 10 1-digit numbers.
How can we try and find the number of 2-digit passwords?
Suppose that the first digit is a 3. Then, how many ways are there for the 2nd digit?
This is just the number of 1-digit passwords, so it’s just 10.
Now, what if the first digit is a 1?
Again, there are just 10 ways for the second digit. So for each of the 10 choices for the
first digit, there are 10 choices for the 2nd digit. Doing this for all possible first digits, we
see that there are 10×10 = 100 2-digit passwords.
Now, how many 3-digit passwords are there?
W ell, there are 10 choices for the first digit, and for each first digit, there are 100 2-digit
passwords, so it’s just
10×100 = 1000
Notice, we can also just see that there are 10 choices for the first digit. F or each first digit,
there are 10 choices for the 2nd digit. Finally , for each pair of first 2 digit, there are 10
choices for the 3rd digit, so the total number of ways is just
10×10×10 = 103= 1000
.

1.2 F actorials
Definition 1.2.1 (F actorials) .A factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or
equal to a given positive integer. In other words n! =n×(n−1)×(n−2)×···× 1.
Remark 1.2.2
F or math competitions, it is recommended to memorize the following factorials as it will
save you a lot of time:
0! = 1
1! = 1
2! = 2
3! = 6
4! = 24
5! = 120
6! = 720
Definition 1.2.3. A permutation is a possible arrangement of objects in a set where the
order of objects matter.
Example 1.2
Sohil has 1 wrapping paper in each of 4 different colors: red, orange, green, or blue. He
needs to wrap all of them around a box in any order. How many ways are there for him
to do this?
Solution 1.2
Notice that in this problem, we can’t use the same wrapping paper twice so it’s slightly more
complicated. Let’s begin this problem by approaching each layer at a time.
Starting with the innermost layer, how many ways are there to choose a color
for this layer?
W e can choose any of the 4 colors so there are just 4 ways for this to happen.
How many choices are there for the 2nd layer?
F or the 2nd layer, since we only have 1 of each paper, only 3 of the colors are left since
we already used one. Therefore, for the 2nd layer we have 3 choices for the color.
13
Chapter 1. Permutations
F or the 3rd layer, we have already used 2 of the wrapping papers, so there are only 2
choices left. F or the final layer, we have already used 3 of the papers, so we only have 1
choice for the final paper.
Now, how do we find the total number of ways?
W e must multiply all of the numbers since all the choices are independent. F or example,
let’s say the first wrapping paper chosen was red. Then, the number of ways to order the
wrapping papers is simply the number of ways to arrange wrapping papers of 3 different col-
ors. However, notice that this is also true for all the other color choices of the first wrapping
paper (orange, green, and blue).
Therefore, in total, we must multiply by 4 to the number of ways of arranging 3 wrap-
ping papers of different colors. Using this logic, we get that the total number of ways to
arrange the wrapping papers is
4×3×2×1 = 24 .
Notice that this is just 4!.
W e will see later that we can find a general formula in terms of factorials to solve this
type of problem.
Example 1.3
Find the number of ways to arrange 4 different books on a bookshelf.
Solution 1.3
This problem is very similar to the previous one. W e must consider the number of ways for
each book.
There are 4 choices for the first book on the bookshelf. After that there are 3 books left, so
there are 3 choices for the 2nd book. Continuing on, there are 2 choices for the 3rd book,
and 1 choice for the 4th book.
Therefore, the total number of ways is just
4×3×2×1 = 4! = 24

There are 4 different AMC 8 videos. Every student in the class watches the videos in a
different order. What is the maximum number of students in the class?

Theorem 1.2.4
The number of ways of arranging n distinct objects is just
n! =n×(n−1)×(n−2)×···× 1
1.3 Permutations F undamentals
Example 1.5
Sam has 5 different stamps and is making a Christmas card where he puts 3 different
stamps in a line. How many different Christmas card designs can he make?
Video Solution
Theorem 1.3.1 (Permutations F ormula)
The number of ways to order kobjects out of ntotal objects is
nPk=n!
(n−k)!=n×(n−1)×(n−2)×···× (n−(k−1))
Example 1.6
Evaluate7P3.
15
Chapter 1. Permutations
Solution 1.4
If we compare the expression7P3to the formulanPk, we have n= 7 andk= 3 . Substituting
these values in the formula for permutations,
7P3=7!
(7−3)!
=7!
4!
= 7×(7−1)×...×(7−(3−1))
= 7×6×5
= 210
Remark 1.3.2
Notice how we can use this formula as a shortcut to the previous problem.
Example 1.7
Find the number of ways of selecting a president, vice president, and secretary from a
group of 7 people.
Solution 1.5
This is very similar to the factorials problems, except now we only have to order positions.
How can we approach the problem?
Let’s consider the number of ways for each position separately .
There are 7 choices for the president. Now, because there are only 6 people left, there
are 6 choices for the vice president. Then, because 2 of the people are already chosen for the
president and vice president, there are 5 choices for the secretary .
In total, the number of ways is
7×6×5 = 210
1.4 Digit Permutations
16
Chapter 1. Permutations
Example 1.8
How many 4 digit numbers have all digits distinct?
Solution 1.6
Let’s consider the number of ways to form this number digit by digit.
F or the first digit, how many choices do we have? Remember, the first digit of a num-
ber cannot be 0 so there are 9 choices (any number from 1 to 9).
How do we handle the condition that the numbers must have distinct digits?
However, unlike the first digit, the 2nd digit can be 0. The 2nd digit can be any num-
ber from 0 to 9 except the digit chosen as the first digit, so there are
10−1 = 9
choices. F or the 3rd digit, again, it can be anything from 0 to 9 except the 2 digits already
chosen, so there are
10−2 = 8
choices. F or the final digit, there are 10 - 3 = 7 choices.
So, the total number of possible numbers is
9×9×8×7 = 4536
Remark 1.4.1
Generally , in these types of problems, we want to consider the most restrictive conditions
first. F or example, in this problem, if we started at the units digit, we would have had
issues in calculating the number of options for the thousands digit so we would have
had to do casework, which is a more advanced technique that will be covered in a later
chapter.
Example 1.9
How many 4 digit numbers exist such that the first digit is odd and the other 3 digits
are even and all digits distinct?
17
Chapter 1. Permutations
Solution 1.7
The first digit has 5 choices (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9). The 2nd digit also has 5 choices (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).
Do we have to subtract any of the choices of the 2nd digit to make sure the
numbers are distinct?
Keep in mind that although the digits have to be distinct, the 2nd digit is even and the
first digit is odd, so there is no overlap.
The 3rd digit can be any even number except the one chosen for the 2nd digit, so it has 4
choices. The 4th digit can be any even number except those chosen for the 2nd and 3rd digit.
In total, the number of 4 digit numbers with these constraints is
5×5×4×3 = 300
Example 1.10
How many 5 digit palindromes are there? A palindrome is a number that reads the
same forward and backward.
Video Solution
Example 1.11 (Omega Learn)
How many 6 digit numbers exist such that all the digits are distinct, and it’s first 2 digits
are 6 or more, the last 2 digits are 5 or less, and the 3rd digit is a nonzero multiple of
7?

1.5 Circular Arrangements
Theorem 1.5.1 (Circular Arrangements)
The number of ways of arranging n objects in a circle where rotations of the same
arrangement aren’t considered distinct is (n−1)!
The number of ways of arranging n objects in a circle where rotations of the same
arrangement aren’t considered distinct and reflections of the same arrangement aren’t
considered distinct is(n−1)!
2
Remark 1.5.2
The reason that this is true is because we can simply fix 1 person to be at the top
and there are (n−1)! ways to arrange the other people. This accounts for rotations
since rotating an arrangement will result in someone else on top. W e divide by 2 for
reflections because of symmetry on both the left and right sides of the person chosen to
be at the top.
19
Chapter 1. Permutations
Example 1.12
How many ways are there to arrange 5 people in a circle if rotations are not counted as
distinct orientations?
Solution 1.8
When things are arranged in a circle, we can fix the position of one person, and look for
arrangements of others.
How many other people are left to arrange?
W e can simply apply the formula for 5 people where rotations don’t matter. This is just
(5−1)! = 4! = 24
Example 1.13 (Omega Learn)
How many ways are there to arrange 5 people around a circle such that 2 of the people,
Alex and Bob, must sit next to each other. Note that rotations are not counted as
distinct orientations.
Video Solution
Example 1.14 (Omega Learn)
Gauss, Pauli, Einstein, Newton, Edison, and F araday are sitting at a circular table.
Einstein, Newton, and F araday are enemies so they refuse to sit next to each other.
With this condition, how many ways are there for the 6 physicists to sit at the table if
rotations are not counted as distinct orientations?
Solution 1.9
Without the condition, the answer would just be (6−1)! = 5! = 120 as we can fix 1 of the 6
people at the top and permute the remaining 5 people.
Where must the enemies sit so that none of them are sitting next to each other?
Since there are only 6 total people, there must be exactly one other person between each of
the enemies as seen in the diagram below where the red X’s represent the enemies.
20
Chapter 1. Permutations
Should we again try to fix someone at the top to deal with rotations?
Y es! By fixing Gauss at the top (arbitrarily), we can now simply order the remaining 5
people without having to worry about the rotation condition.
How many ways to permute the enemies?
Note that the 3 possible locations of the enemies is fixed so there are 3! ways to permute
them.
How many ways to permute the people with no enemies?
W e already fixed Gauss (someone without enemies) so there are 2! ways to permute the
other 2 people who don’t have enemies.
In total, our answer is
3!×2! = 12

Chapter 2. Combinations
2.1 Combinations F undamentals
Definition 2.1.1. A combination is a collection of items where the order of the items does
not matter.
Remark 2.1.2
Usually , the words permute, order does matter, etc. imply a permutation while the
words choose, select, order doesn’t matter, etc. imply a combination
Example 2.1
How many ways can I select 3 pencils from 6 different pencils?
Solution 2.1
Let’s try to approach this similarly to permutations.
There are 6 choices for the first pencil, 5 choices for the 2nd pencil, and 4 choices for the 3rd
pencil.
So the total number of ways is just
6×5×4 = 120
Is this the number of ways of choosing or arranging?
Remember that we are just selecting 3 pencils, so the order doesn’t matter. Therefore,
we are overcounting many cases. F or example, choosing pencil A first and pencil B second
is the same as choosing pencil B first and pencil A second.
So how do we account for this?
W ell, to answer that question, we must consider how many ways there are to order the
pencils. Let’s say we have 3 pencils.
How many ways are there to order them?
This is just 3!because we are arranging 3 objects in order. Therefore, we are overcount-
ing by a factor of 3!.

Since they must be from the 6 experienced applicants, there are
/parenleftBigg6
2/parenrightBigg
=6×5
2!=30
2= 15
Next, how many ways are there to select the 5 other employees?
Since 2 of the experienced applicants were already selected, there are 4 experienced ap-
plicants and 7 inexperienced applicants left.
Therefore, we must select 4 employees out of the 11 remaining people. W e can do this
in/parenleftBigg11
4/parenrightBigg
=11×10×9×8
4!=11×10×72
24= 11×10×72
24= 11×10×3 = 330
Therefore, in total, how many ways are there to select the 3 managers and 5
other employees?
Since there are 15 ways to select the managers and 330 ways to select the other employ-
ees, there will be 15×330 = 4950 ways to select both the managers and the employees.

Find the number of possible distinguishable arrangements of the 8 coins.

First, let’s deal with the orderings of the coins.
How many ways to arrange the 4 gold and 4 silver coins?
W e can use the word rearrangement formula to get8!
4!×4!= 70 . Now, we will the num-
ber of ways to put the coins face up or face down in the stack
If a coin is face down, what must the coin above it be?
It can be anything and the faces will never meet.
If a coin is face up, what must the coin above it be?
It must also be face up as if it’s face down, then the faces will meet.
The moment the coin first becomes face up, all the remaining coins on top must be face
up as well! If none of the coins are face up, then there is 1 orientation.
How many orientations exist if at least 1 of the coins is face up?

Example 3.1
How many ways are there to arrange the letters in the word OMEGA?
Solution 3.1
This is just like arranging 5 distinct books on a shelf. Since all the letters are different, there
are just
5! = 120
ways to arrange the 5 letters.
Example 3.2
How many ways are there to arrange the letters in the word SUNNY?
Solution 3.2
This looks similar to the previous example.
Can we use the same factorial formula again?
If that were the case, then our answer would just be 5! = 120 . Unfortunately , this prob-
lem is more complicated because now there are 2 N’s. Therefore, some arrangements will be
overcounted. Let us call the two N’s N1andN2
F or example, N1USN 2YandN2USN 1Yare the same arrangement, but our factorial formula
will count them as different arrangements.
How can we account for this overcouting?
The valid arrangement NUSNY is counted twice. Notice that we count each arrangement
twice where the position of two N’s is swapped.
Is this the case for all rearrangements?
Y es, indeed. F or any arrangement of the letters in the word SUNNY, we get 2 different
arrangements of the word: N1on the left and N2on the right, N2on the left and N1on the
right.
41
Chapter 3. W ord Rearrangements
Therefore, the number of valid arrangements is just1
2the original 5! arrangements, which
gives
5!
2= 60
Remark 3.1.1
Remember that the factorial formula only works if all the letters are different.

Theorem 3.1.2 (W ord Rearrangements)
The number of ways to order a word is
n!
d1!×d2!×d3!×...
where nis the number of letters and d1,d2,d3,... are the number of times each of the
duplicate letters that appear in the word.
Remark 3.1.3
This may seem complicated, but it essentially means the number of rearrangements of
an n-letter word is n!. However, since some letters may appear multiple times (let’s say
d times), we must divide by d! for all such letters because there are d! ways to arrange
the duplicate letters that we are overcounting.

later in geometric counting.
Example 3.3
How many ways are there to rearrange the letters in COMPUTER such that the C, O,
M, and P stay together (not necessarily in the same order)?
Solution 3.3
This problem is slightly different from the standard word rearrangement problems because
we now have a constraint.
How should we deal with the condition that the COMP must stay together?
Let’s treat COMP as 1 block. Since the letters anyways have to stay together, let call this
block a COMP . Now, instead, we can find the number of arrangments of COMP UTER.
How many ways are there to arrange COMP UTER?
Notice that this is just 5! since all the letters (or symbols) are different.
Now, are we done, or is there something we forgot to account for?
Remember that letters in the word COMP can appear in any order inside the box, so
we have to also account for rearrangements of these letters within the COMP .
F or each unique arrangement of COMP UTER, how many ways are there to

4.1 Probability F undamentals
Definition 4.1.1. Probability is the likelihood of something happening. T o calculate prob-
ability , you need to know how many possible options or outcomes there are and how many
right combinations there are.
Theorem 4.1.2 (Probability)
probability =T otal number of desired outcomes
T otal number of possible outcomes
Example 4.1
What is the probability of rolling a prime number on a 6 sided dice?
Solution 4.1
T o calculate probability , we need to find the number of successful and total outcomes.
How many successful outcomes are there?
W e can see that there are 3 prime numbers from 1 to 6 (2, 3 and 5).
Next, how many total outcomes are there?
W ell this is just 6 because it can be any number from 1 to 6.
Therefore, since the probability is just the number of successful outcomes divided by the
total number of outcomes, the probability is
3
6=1

4.2 Distinguishability
Example 4.2
I have cards numbered from 1 to 10. What is the probability I pick a pair of 2 different
cards that have an odd product?
Solution 4.2
This is a rather simple example however it demonstrates an important point about distin-
guishability in probability problems.
What must happen for the cards to have an odd product?
Both cards must be odd.
How many pairs of cards have both cards odd?
If order does not matter, then there are/parenleftBig5
2/parenrightBig
= 10 combinations. However, if the order
does matter, then there are 5×4 = 20 permutations.
How many total pairs of cards can be chosen?
If order does not matter, then there are/parenleftBig10
2/parenrightBig
= 45 combinations. However, if the order
does matter, then there are 10×9 = 90 permutations.
So does the order matter of the cards in the pair matter or not?
If the order of the cards in the pair does matter, then the probability is20
90=2
9. If the order
of the cards in the pair does not matter, then the probability is10
45=2
9.
Why are the probabilities are the same?
When dealing with ordered pairs, the number of successful and total pairs were multiplied
by2! so they would cancel out when dividing!
Remark 4.2.1
In probability problems, whether you decide to multiply for order or not is up to you as
both will give the same probability .
51
Chapter 4. Probability
Example 4.3
The sum of 2 positive integers is 4. Find the probability that one of the integers is a 2.
Solution 4.3
There are 2 cases:
1. Both integers are 2
2. One integer is a 3 and the other is a 1
So is the probability just1
2?
No! While there are only 2 cases, they both have different chances of happening.
How many ways are there for each case to happen?
There is only 1 way where both integers can be 2 however there are 2 ways one of the
integers is a 1 and the other is a 3 as we can flip them. The 2nd case is more likely .
What is the probability with this knowledge?
There are a total of 3 cases of which 1 satisfies the condition so the probability is1
3.
Remark 4.2.2
If you decide not to account for order when doing probability problems, make sure the
number of orderings is consistent across all cases. In the first problem, every pair had
2 orderings so it was okay to neglect order. However, in the 2nd problem, the 2 cases
had different number of orderings so this didn’t work.
4.3 Casework in Probability
Concept 4.3.1
Often, when a problem asks for the probability of an event happening, we may have
to do casework to find the number of successful outcomes and divide that by the total
number of outcomes which is usually easy to find.

4.4 Probability of Independent Events
Example 4.4
Sohil randomly picks a number from 1 to 10. Sejal randomly picks a number from 1 to
25. What is the probability that the product of the numbers they choose is odd?
Solution 4.4
F or this problem, although it is possible to find the number of successful and total outcomes
amongst both picks of numbers, there is an easier way to solve the problem.
T o start, what do we know about 2 numbers whose product is odd?
F or the product of 2 numbers to be odd, both numbers must be odd because if any of
the numbers are even, then the product will also have a factor of 2 in it.
Next, how can find the probability that Sohil and Sejal pick odd numbers?
W e could find find the number of successful and total outcomes amongst both picks of
numbers as mentioned earlier, but instead, we can simply find the probabilities of each of
them picking an odd number.
The probability of Sohil picking an odd number is5
10=1
2.
The probability of Sejal picking an odd number is13
25since there are 13 odd numbers from 1
to 25.
Now, how do we find the overall probability of both of them picking an odd
number?
W e must multiply the probabilities.
53
Chapter 4. Probability
Therefore, the overall probability is
1
2×13
25=13

.
Remark 4.4.1
Whenever we need to find the probabilities of 2 independent events happening (the
results of the events don’t depend on each other), we can simply find the probability of
each event individually and multiply them together.
Example 4.2 (Omega Learn)
Person A rolls a dice with the numbers 1, 1, 2, 6, 15, 30 and Person B rolls a dice
with the numbers 1, 2, 4, 18, 28, 44. What is the probability that the product of the 2

4.5 Probability of Dependent Events
Example 4.5
Alex, Betty , Chase, Derek, Emma, Fiona, and George are racing in a marathon. If they
finish in a random order, what is the probability that Chase is 1st and George is 6th?
Solution 4.5
Let’s see how to solve this problem with dependent events.
Can we just use the technique above to solve this problem?
That won’t work because this time, Chase’ rank affects George’s rank, such as in the case
where Chase is 6th which would make it impossible for George to be 6th, so the events affect
each other.
Then, how do we approach this question?
T o do this, let’s first consider the probability Chase is 1st and then find the probability
54
Chapter 4. Probability
George is 6th given that Chase is 1st.
What is the probability that Chase is selected first?
Because there are 7 people who can be first and Chase is one of those persons, the probability
is simply1
7since they finish in a random order.
Next, what is the probability that George is selected 6th if Chase is first?
Notice that now out of the 7 original positions, only 6 are left. Therefore, since all posi-
tions are equally likely for George, the probability he is 6th is1
6.
Now, how do we find the overall probability?
Notice that we only need to find the probability that both Chase is first and George is
6th. Therefore, we can just find the probability of Chase being first and multiply that by
the probability that George is 6th.
Therefore, our answer is just
1
7×1
6=1
42
.
Remark 4.5.1
When the events are dependent like in the example above, the probability of both events
happening (say A and B) is the probability of event A happening times the probability
that event B happens given that event A already happened.

5.1 Casework F undamentals
Concept 5.1.1
Casework is solving counting or probability problems by considering the different cases
and adding them together. Many counting or probability problems can be solved by
dividing a problem into several cases and calculating arrangements and probabilities for
each case before summing them together.
Y ou should try casework when there are no other obvious approaches as it is one of the
most common techniques on the AMC 8.
Example 5.1
T wo dice are rolled. What is the number of the ways that the sum of the numbers rolled
is 3?
Solution 5.1
T o do this, let’s take cases based on the first roll.
How many ways are there for two dice to sum to 3?
Case 1: First roll is a 1
If the first roll is a 1, then the second roll must be 2.
Case 2: First roll is a 2
If the first roll is a 2, then the second roll must be 1.
Case 3: First roll is a 3 or more
If the first roll is anything 3 or more, then the sum will always be at least 4 (since the
2nd roll is at least 1), so this is not possible.
Therefore, in total, there are 2 ways.

This is a another casework problems. The first step is to identify the different cases.
What are the different ways to draw a winning pair?
W e can either have the same color or the same letter. Note that having the same color
and having the same letter are not possible as that would mean drawing the same card twice
which is not possible. W e consider the cases separately .
Case 1: The 2 cards are the same color.
F or this case, we have 2 choices for which color both cards will be.
How many ways are there to select 2 cards from 4 cards of a given color?
Since there are 4 cards of each color, and we must select 2 of them, there are just/parenleftBig4
2/parenrightBig
ways to select 2 cards.
Therefore, the number of ways to pick 2 cards of the same color will just be the number of
colors times the number of ways to select 2 cards from that color, which is
2×/parenleftBigg4
2/parenrightBigg
= 2×4×3
2= 12
Case 2: The 2 cards are the same letter.
F or this case, we have 4 choices for which letter both cards will have.
Now, how many color choices are possible for the 2 cards?
Remember that order does not matter in our winning pair. F or each letter, there are only 2
cards available to draw (red or green). Because we need to draw 2 cards for a winning pair,
we need to draw both of the 2 cards available to form a winning pair, so there is only 1 way
to do this. Another way to think about this is that there are/parenleftBig2
2/parenrightBig
= 1 way to pick the colors.
68
Chapter 5. Casework
Therefore, the number of ways to pick 2 cards of the same letter is just 4×1 = 4 .
In total, the total number of winning pairs is the number of pairs of cards with the same
color plus the number of pairs of cards with the same letter which is
12 + 4 = 16

5.2 Harder Casework Examples
Example 5.3 (Omega Learn)
There are 3 identical blue boxes, 6 identical green boxes, and 5 distinct items. Each of
the items must be placed into either a green or blue box, and each box can contain a
maximum of 1 item. Assuming all of the boxes are different, how many ways are there
to do this?
Solution 5.3
There are 5 items to be put in some of the 9 green and blue boxes, so we must choose 5 of
these 9 boxes to put the items into.
How can we divide this problem into cases?
W e can choose our cases based on the number of green and blue boxes we are selecting.
The cases are
1. 3 blue boxes, 2 green boxes
2. 2 blue boxes, 3 green boxes
69
Chapter 5. Casework
3. 1 blue box, 4 green boxes
4. 0 blue boxes, 5 green boxes
Notice that this covers all the cases because it covers all possible number of blue boxes.
Clearly , 6 green boxes is impossible since we only have to select 5 of them to put items into.
Also, make sure to keep in mind that the boxes of the same color are identical.
Case 1: 3 blue boxes, 2 green boxes
F or this case, how many ways are there to put 5 items into 3 blue and 2 green
boxes?
W e can count this be seeing that we simply have to choose 3 of the items to place into
the blue boxes, and the other items will be put in green boxes. W e don’t have to worry
about order of the items in the blue boxes (or the green boxes) because the boxes of the
same color are identical. W e can do this in/parenleftBig5
3/parenrightBig
ways.
Case 2: 2 blue boxes, 3 green boxes Again, we do this by choosing 2 of the items to
put into blue boxes, and the remaining 3 items will be put into green boxes. W e can do this
in/parenleftBig5
2/parenrightBig
ways.
Case 3: 1 blue boxes, 4 green boxes Out of the 5 items, we must choose 1 of them for
a blue box and the remaining 4 will go in green boxes. W e can do this in/parenleftBig5
1/parenrightBig
ways.
Case 4: 0 blue boxes, 5 green boxes Because all of the items must go in green boxes,
there is only 1 way to do this.
In total among all the cases, there are
/parenleftBigg5
3/parenrightBigg

2/parenrightBigg

+ 1 =5×4×3

1+ 1 = 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 = 26

Chapter 6. Complementary Counting
6.1 Complementary Counting F undamentals
Complementary counting is the problem solving technique of counting the opposite of the
problem constraint and subtracting that from the total number of cases. In combinatorics
problems, the keyword “at least” generally indicates that complementary counting may be
helpful.
Example 6.1
I roll 2 fair 6-sided dice. How many ways are there for the sum of the numbers to be 11
or less?
Solution 6.1
W e could do this problem by casework by considering the number of ways to roll all of the
numbers from 1 to 11. However, this will take a lot of time and is very tedious. Instead,
let’s try finding the opposite of what we are trying to count.
What is the opposite of rolling a sum of numbers 11 or less?
Notice that the sum of 2 numbers on 2 dice is at most 12 because the maximum roll on
each dice is 6. Therefore, the only possibility for the sum of numbers on 2 dice that results
in it not being 11 or less is for the sum to be 12.
How many ways are there to have a sum of 12 on 2 dice?
The only possibility for this is if both dice roll a 6, so there is only 1 way .
Next, we must find the total number of ways to roll 2 dice. This is just 6×6 = 36 .
Then, how many rolls of 2 dice result in a sum that is 11 or less?
This is just the number of total possible rolls minus the number of rolls that sum to a
number more than 11, which is
36−1 = 35

6.2 Complementary Counting with Casework
Example 6.3
I roll 2 fair 6-sided dice. What is the probability that the sum of the numbers is 5 or
more?
82
Chapter 6. Complementary Counting
Solution 6.2
In this problem, we will first find the number of ways to have a sum of 5 or more. W e could
do casework, but there is a much faster solution with complementary counting.
What is the opposite of rolling a sum of numbers 5 or more?
Because the minimum sum of 2 dice is 2 (since each dice must roll at least a 1), the dice
rolls must sum to 2, 3, or 4 for the sum to not be 5 or more. W e divide this into cases.
Case 1: The 2 dice sum to 2
There is only 1 way for this to happen (both dice are 1).
Case 2: The 2 dice sum to 3
If the first dice roll is a 1, then the 2nd dice roll must be a 2. If the first dice roll is a
2, then the 2nd dice roll must be a 1. If the first dice roll is 3 or more, then the sum will be
at least 4 or more, so this case doesn’t count.
So, in total there are 2 ways for the sum to be 3.
Case 3: The 2 dice sum to 4
If the first dice roll is a 1, then the 2nd dice roll must be a 3. If the first dice roll is a
2, then the 2nd dice roll must be a 2. If the first dice roll is a 3, then the 2nd dice roll must
be a 1. If the first dice roll is 4 or more, then the sum will be at least 5 or more, so this case
doesn’t count.
So in total there are 3 ways for this case.
Therefore, amongst all 3 cases, there are a total of 1+2+3 = 6 ways to not have a sum of 5
or more.
Next, the total number of dice rolls is 6×6 = 36 . Therefore, the number of rolls result-
ing in a sum of 5 or more is just 36−6 = 30 .
Therefore, the probability of this happening is
30
36=5

Chapter 6. Complementary Counting
Remark 6.2.1
Often times, we have to use complementary counting in conjunction with other concepts
like casework and probability .
Example 6.4
How many subsets of the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 , 9, 10} have at least 1 even number
and do not contain all of the elements?
Solution 6.3
How can we use complementary counting?
W e can find the total number of subsets and subtract the subsets which have no even num-
bers and contain all of the elements. Note that both having no even numbers and containing
all of the elements cannot happen, so we don’t have to worry about overlap between the
subsets that don’t work.
Case 1: Subset contains all of the elements
There is only 1 subset that contains all of the elements (the original set).
Case 2: Subset contains no even elements
If there are no even elements, then we simply have to pick some odd numbers from {1,
3, 5, 7, 9} for our subset.
How many ways are there to do this?
Remember that each element has 2 choices (to be in subset or not in subset), so the number
of ways to form our subset from just odd numbers is 25= 32 .
Therefore in total, 1 + 32 = 33 ways don’t work.
Next, how many total subsets are there?
Since there are 10 elements and each element has 2 choices, there are 210= 1024 subsets.
Therefore the number of valid subsets is 1024−33 = 991

Chapter 7. Principle of Inclusion Exclusion (PIE)
7.1 PIE Strategies
Definition 7.1.1. Overcounting is the process of counting more than what you need and
then systematically subtracting the parts which do not belong.
Definition 7.1.2. The principle of inclusion and exclusion (PIE) is a counting technique
that uses overcounting to compute the number of elements that satisfy at least one of sev-
eral properties while guaranteeing that elements satisfying more than one property are not
counted twice.
7.2 PIE for 2 Events
Example 7.1
Find how many numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive) that are divisible by 2 or 7.
Solution 7.1
T o solve this problem, let’s first find how many numbers are divisible by 2 and how many
numbers are divisible by 7
How many numbers from 1 to 100 are divisible by 2?
Every 2nd number is divisible by 2, so all the numbers from 2×1to2×50 work. Therefore,
from 1 to 100 there are 50 numbers divisible by 2.
How many numbers from 1 to 100 are divisible by 7?
Every 7th number is divisible by 7, so all of the numbers from 7×1to7×14 work. W e
calculate this by seeing that100
7is a little more than 14 so 7×14 is the largest multiple of 7
less than 100. Therefore, there from 1 to 100 are 14 numbers divisible by 7.
Are there any numbers overcounted between the multiples of 2 and the mul-
tiples of 7?
F or a number to be both a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 7, it must be a multiple of
7×2 = 14 . Therefore, we are overcounting these numbers since we are counting them twice
as part of the multiples of 2 and multiples of 7.
How many numbers from 1 to 100 are divisible by 14?
92
Chapter 7. Principle of Inclusion Exclusion (PIE)
Every 14th number is divisible by 14, so all of the numbers from 14×1to14×7work.
Therefore, from 1 to 100 there are 7 numbers divisible by 14.
Therefore, in total, the number of numbers that are multiple of 2 or 7 are the number
of multiples of 2 plus the number of multiples of 7 minus the multiples of 14.
This gives us an answer of 50 + 14 −7 = 57 .
Definition 7.2.1 (Union Symbol) .|A∪B|is the union of elements in both A and B (i.e.
all elements that are in set A or set B, but duplicates are only written once)
Definition 7.2.2 (Intersection Symbol) .|A∩B|is the intersection of elements in both A
and B (i.e. only those elements which are in both sets)
Theorem 7.2.3 (Principle of Inclusion Exclusion for 2 Sets)
Given two sets, |A1|and|A2|
|A1∪A2|=|A1|+|A2|−|A1∩A2|
Basically , we count the number of possibilities in 2 ”things” and subtract the duplicates.
Example 7.2 (Omega Learn)
How many subsets of the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} have at most 4 even numbers
and at most 2 elements that are multiples of 3?
This is another problem we will solve using the principle of inclusion and exclusion and the
subsets formula we learned earlier.
Solution 7.2
How we can apply the Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion to this problem?
Notice how there are 5 even numbers, and we have to find how many subsets have at most 4
even numbers. Similarly , there are 3 multiples of 3, and we have to find how many elements
have at most 2 multiples of 3.
W e can see that there are fewer cases that don’t satisfy the condition, so it is better to use
complementary counting. W e will first count the number of subsets that have more than 4
93
Chapter 7. Principle of Inclusion Exclusion (PIE)
even numbers and have more than 2 multiple of 3.
First, how many subsets have more than 4 even numbers?
Since there are 5 multiples of 2 from 1 to 10 (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), to have more than 4 mul-
tiples of 2 means having all of the multiples of 2 (only 1 way to choose this). F rom the
remaining 5 numbers, there are 25possible subsets. Therefore, in total, there are 1×25= 25
subsets that have more than 4 multiples of 2.
Next, how many subsets have more than 2 multiples of 3?
Since there are 3 multiples of 3 from 1 to 10 (3, 6, 9), to have more than 2 multiples of
3 means having all of the multiples of 3 (only 1 ways to choose this). F rom the remaining
7 numbers, there are 27possible subsets. By similar logic, in total, there will be 1×27= 27
possible subsets.
How many subsets are we overcounting that have all of the even numbers and
multiples of 3 from 1 to 10?
F or a subset to have all the multiples of 2 and 3, it must contain all the elements from
2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 (only 1 way to choose this). F rom the remaining 3 numbers, there are
1×23= 23possible subsets.
Therefore, in total, the number of subsets that don’t satisfy our original condition is 27+
25−23= 128 + 32 −8 = 152 .
The total number of possible subsets of the original set of 10 numbers is 210= 1024 , so the
number of valid subsets is 1024−152 = 872
Remark 7.2.4
When the number of cases that don’t work is much less than the number of cases that
do work, it can often be helpful to use complementary counting along with PIE.

7.3 PIE for 3 Events
Theorem 7.3.1 (Principle of Inclusion Exclusion for 3 Sets)
Given three sets, |A1|,|A2|,|A3|,
|A1∪A2∪A3|=|A1|+|A2|+|A3|−|A1∩A2|−|A1∩A3|−|A1∩A3|+|A1∩A2∩A3|
In this formula, we count the number of possibilities in 3 ”things”, subtract the possi-
bilities that are duplicates in all 3 pairs of sets, and add back the number of duplicates
that are in all 3 sets.
Example 7.3
How many numbers less than or equal to 193 are multiples of 2, 3, or 5?
95
Chapter 7. Principle of Inclusion Exclusion (PIE)
Solution 7.3
First, let’s find how many numbers are divisible by 2, how many numbers are divisible by 3,
and how many numbers are divisible by 5.
Every 2nd number is divisible by 2, so all the numbers from 2×1to2×96 work. Therefore,
there are 96 numbers divisible by 2 less than or equal to 193
Every 3rd number is divisible by 3, so all the numbers from 3×1to3×64 work. Therefore,
there are 64 numbers divisible by 3 less than or equal to 193
Every 5th number is divisible by 5, so all the numbers from 5×1to5×38 work. Therefore,
there are 38 numbers divisible by 5 less than or equal to 193.
Next, we must subtract numbers divisible by two of the numbers 2, 3, or 5.
F or this to happen, what values must the numbers be divisible by?
Numbers divisible by 2 and 3 or numbers divisible by 2×3 = 6 are counted twice. Simi-
larly , numbers divisible by 2 and 5 or 2×5 = 10 are counted twice and numbers divisible by
3 and 5 or 3×5 = 15 are counted twice. Therefore, we are overcounting multiples of each of
6, 10, and 15, so we must subtract them.
Every 6th number is divisible by 6, so all the numbers from 6×1to6×32 work. Therefore,
there are 32 numbers divisible by 6 less than or equal to 193
Every 10th number is divisible by 10, so all the numbers from 10×1to10×19 work. There-
fore, there are 19 numbers divisible by 10 less than or equal to 193
Every 15th number is divisible by 5, so all the numbers from 15×1to15×12 work. There-
fore, there are 12 numbers divisible by 15 less than or equal to 193.
If we subtract the overcounted numbers above, did we remove too much?
Next, we look at how many times multiples of 2, 3, and 5, or multiples of 2×3×5 = 30
were counted. W ell, they were originally counted 3 times as part of the multiples of 2, 3, and
5. Then, they were subtracted 3 times as part of the multiples of 6, 10, and 15. Therefore,
they have been counted 0 times! But, we need to count them exactly once, so we must add
back the number of multiples of 2×3×5 = 30 .
Every 30th number is divisible by 30, so all the numbers from 30×1to30×6work. There-
fore, there are 6 numbers divisible by 30 less than or equal to 193.
In total, to find the number of multiples of 2, 3, or 5 we have to add the number of multiples
96
Chapter 7. Principle of Inclusion Exclusion (PIE)
of 2, the number of multiples of 3, the number of multiples of 5. Then, we have to subtract
the number of multiples of 6, 10, and 15. And finally , we have to add back the number of
multiples of 30.
This gives us an answer of 96 + 64 + 38 −32−19−12 + 6 = 141 .

Concept 7.4.1 (PIE Generalization)
The same principle to applies to more than when counting more than 3 events. F or any
nevents, to find the total number of ways such that any of the events occur
1. Find number of ways each individual event occurs in.
2. F or every pair of 2 events, subtract number of ways where both of them occur
3. F or every triplet of 3 events, add back number of ways where all 3 of them occur
4. F or every quadruplet of 4 events, subtract number of ways where all 4 occur...
5. F or all nevents, add (if nis odd) or subtract (if nis even) number of ways where
all of them occur
Alternate between adding the number of ways and subtracting the number of ways
until you reach the case where all nevents occur. Whether you add or subtract the
number of ways where all nevents occur depends on whether nis odd since we alternate
between adding and subtracting.

8.1 Stars and Bars F undamentals
Example 8.1
How many ways are there to distribute 8 identical computers amongst 3 students?
Solution 8.1
Make sure to keep in mind that the computers are identical. If the computers were not
identical, then we would just have 3 choices for each computer, so our answer would just be
38.
However, when the computers are identical, only the number of computers each student
has matters. T o start, let’s say we have 8 computers in a line: CCCCCCCC. Therefore, we
must divide these computers amongst 3 students.
How can we represent the 8 computers being divided amongst the 3 students?
W e can think about having 3 groups. W e can simply let the leftmost group be for stu-
dent one, the middle group for student 2, and the rightmost group for student 3 because
only the number of computers each student has matters, so ordering is irrelevant.
How can we divide the 8 C’s amongst 3 groups?
W e can do this by just placing 2 bars somewhere in between the 8 C’s! Everything left
of the first bar goes to student 1, everything in the middle goes to student 2, and everything
to the right of the 2nd bar goes to student 3. Therefore, the number of ways to distribute
the computers is simply the number of ways to insert 2 bars in between 8 C’s. Examples:
CC|CCCCC |C - 2 for student 1, 5 for student 2, 1 for student 3
|CCCC |CCCC - 0 for student 1, 4 for student 2, 4 for student 3
C|CCCCCCC |- 1 for student 1, 7 for student 2, 0 for student 3
CCCCCCCC ||- 8 for student 1, 0 for student 2, 0 for student 3
How do we find the number of ways to insert 2 bars in between 8 C’s?
W e can think of having 10 slots (each slot for either a bar or a C). Then, we can choose 2 of
these slots for bars.
Therefore, the numbers of ways to select two slots out of the 10 slots (i.e. choose two
105
Chapter 8. Stars and Bars
slots to put the two bars out of the 10 slots) is
/parenleftBigg10
2/parenrightBigg
=10×9
2= 45
Example 8.1

Video Solution
Theorem 8.1.1 (Stars and Bars)
The number of ways to place nindistinguishable objects into kdistinguishable bins is
/parenleftBiggn+k−1
n/parenrightBigg
Remark 8.1.2
The reason this is true is because you can consider placing k−1bars in between n
objects which would be equivalent to having n+ (k−1) slots and choosing k−1slots
from those. This can be written as:
/parenleftBiggn+k−1
k−1/parenrightBigg
which is equivalent to/parenleftBiggn+k−1
n/parenrightBigg
This general idea is important to understand because tricky problems will often add
additional conditions.
Remark 8.1.3
Make sure to remember that Stars and Bars only works if the objects that are being
distributed are identical!
8.2 Stars and Bars with Constraints
106
Chapter 8. Stars and Bars
Concept 8.2.1
Stars and bars is extremely useful, and can often be adapted based on situations. F or
example, if each bin has to have at least 1 object in it we assign each bin 1 object to
start off with and apply our formula with n−kobjects and kdistinguishable bins.
Example 8.2
7 astronauts are stranded in space with only 10 identical meals left. Every astronaut
must receive at least 1 meal or else, they will starve. How many ways are there to
distribute meals under this constraint?
Solution 8.2
This problem is very similar to the previous problem, except we now have an additional
constraint, so the formula won’t work. Let’s focus on the constraint, since it’s the most
complicated part of the problem.
How can we deal with the condition that every astronaut must get at least 1
meal?
If every astronaut must receive at least 1 meal and all the meals are identical, we can
simply pre-distribute 7 of the meals and give 1 to each astronaut. Notice that now, no
matter where the remaining meals are distributed, every astronaut will get 1 meal or more.
Now, how can we use stars on bars on the remaining problem?
After 7 meals are distributed, only 3 remain. There is no constraint on who these 3 meals
can go to, so it can go to any of the 7 astronauts. T o divide these 3 meals into 7 groups, we
can place 6 bars in between the 3 meals. Then, out of the 3+6=9 slots for meals and bars,
we must choose 6 of them for bars.
W e can do this in/parenleftBig9

Example 8.3
What’s the probability that the sum of the top faces on five regular 6-sided dice is 24?
107
Chapter 8. Stars and Bars
Solution 8.3
Before we begin, note that each dice must be a value from 1 to 6. There is no way to use
stars and bars directly because it will not account for the constraint that the maximum of
each dice roll is a 6.
How can we use stars and bars for this problem?
Let the default for each dice be a 6. Then the maximum score is 30, we must essentially
distribute 6 negatives to the 5 dice (-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1).
W e can see that to distribute 6 negatives to 5 dice, we must have 4 bars to separate the
negatives into 5 groups for the dice. W e then have 9 slots and must choose 4 of them for
bars. W e can do this in/parenleftBig10
4/parenrightBig
= 210 ways.
Are there any cases we are overcounting?
Because the minimum value of a dice roll is 1, each dice can only take at most 5 nega-
tives. Therefore, we are overcounting the possibilities where 1 dice receives 6 negatives.
How many ways are there for 1 dice to have 6 negatives?
There are 6 dice, so there are 6 choice for which dice will have all 6 negatives. F rom here,
we can calculate our final answer by subtracting the 6 ways that result in 1 dice receiving
all 6 negatives from/parenleftBig10
4/parenrightBig

dice gets more than 5 negatives.

What must happen so that the enemies don’t sit next to each other?
There must be at least 1 other person between each of the enemies. Let w be the num-

enemies, let ybe the number of people between the 2nd and 3rd enemies, and let zbe the
number of people right of the 3rd enemy .
What conditions must w,x,y,z satisfy?
Firstly , since there are 4 people who are not enemies, we must have w+x+y+z= 4 .

Keep in mind that the answer is not 16 because we can’t just count unit squares!
What’s the easiest and most systematic way to count all possible squares?
W e can break the problem down into 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4 squares.
Case 1: 1x1 squares
F or this case, there are just 4×4 = 16 squares.
Case 2: 2x2 squares
Notice how there are 3 possible choices of rows and 3 possible choices of columns to form a
2x2 square. In total, there are 3×3 = 9 possible 2x2 squares since each choice of two rows
and two columns produces a 2x2 square.
Case 3: 3x3 squares
117
Chapter 9. Geometric Counting
Notice how there are 2 possible choices of rows and 2 possible choices of columns to form a
3x3 square. In total, there are 2×2 = 4 possible 3x3 squares since each choice of two rows
and two columns produces a 3x3 square.
Case 4: 4x4 squares
There is just one 4x4 square (the entire square).
In total, the number of squares of all sizes is
16 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 30

This is another problem that can be solved by tedious casework but has a very slick solution.
What defines a rectangle in a grid?
4 points? Not quite because 4 points don’t necessarily make a rectangle. 2 vertical lines
and 2 horizontal lines define a rectangle as shown in the picture below. In other words, any
2 vertical lines and horizontal lines in this grid will form a rectangle.
118

How can we count the number of rectangles in a grid based on this?
W e simply have to choose 2 vertical lines and 2 horizontal lines!
There are 4 horizontal lines, so there are/parenleftBig4

ways to select 2 horizontal lines that define a
rectangle. Similarly , there are 6 vertical lines, so there are/parenleftBig6

Example 9.4
A rabbit is walking in a coordinate plane and has to get from (0,0) to the carrot at the
point (5,5). If the rabbit can only move 1 unit up or 1 unit right on any given move,
how many ways are there for the rabbit to get to the carrot?
Solution 9.4
This is yet another problem that is tedious to solve with casework. Instead, let’s find a
simpler way to solve this problem. Lets denote a right move by R and an up move by U.
How many right and up moves does the rabbit need to get to the carrot?
120
Chapter 9. Geometric Counting
Because it’s going from (0,0) to (5,5), it needs 5 right moves and 5 up moves. Therefore,
we just need to count the number of ways to make 5 right moves and 5 up moves in any order.
How can we represent the number of ways to make 5 right moves and 5 up
moves (in any order)?
This can be thought of as rearrangements of 5 R and 5 U: RRRRRUUUUU. W e just need
to find all possible rearrangements of this word. Given the total number of characters is 10,
and counting the duplicates (5 R’s and 5 U’s), we can use the word rearrangement formula:
10!
5!×5!= 252
Theorem 9.4.1
The number of ways to get from (0,0) to a point (m,n) moving only up and right is
/parenleftBiggm+n

Remark 9.4.2
Imagine any arrangement string of m R’s and nU’s. Each string would correspond to
a unique path, so to count this, we can use the word rearrangement formula.

Chapter 10. Recursion
10.1 Recursion F undamentals
Definition 10.1.1. Recursion is the process of finding smaller values and using them to
calculate larger values.
Example 10.1
Jeff is climbing a 6 stair staircase. If he can climb 1 or 2 stairs at a time, in how many
distinct ways can he get to the top?
Solution 10.1
W e could do casework, but that would take a long time. Instead, let’s solve this problem for
small values first.
How many ways are there for Jeff to reach the 0th stair (ground)?
Jeff is already there at the start, so there is just 1 way to do that.
How many ways are there for Jeff to reach the 1st stair?
There is only 1 way because he must climb 1 step to reach there from the ground (0th stair).
How many ways are there for Jeff to reach the 2nd stair?
There are 2 ways: 2 single steps or 1 double step from ground (0th stair)
How can Jeff reach the 3rd stair?
Jeff either has to take a single step from the 2nd stair, or a double step from the 1st stair.
Therefore, the number of ways is simply the number of ways to reach the first step plus the
number of ways to reach the 2nd step, which is 1 + 2 = 3 .
How can use the same logic to find the number of ways to reach the nth stair?
T o reach the nth stair, Jeff must take a 1 step from the (n−1)th stair or a double step
from the (n−2)th stair. Therefore, the number of ways of reaching the nth step is the
number of ways of reaching the (n−1)th plus the number of ways of reaching the (n−2)th
stair.
Let’s define a function, f(n), such that f(n) represents the number of ways to reach the
133
Chapter 10. Recursion
nth step. Then, we can write the recursion
f(n) =f(n−1) +f(n−2)
.
The next step is to just iteratively calculate the values of f(n)for all values of n until we
findf(6) , since the staircase has 6 steps. W e already calculated f(1) andf(2) so we can use
them as base cases.
f(1) = 1
f(2) = 2
f(3) = f(3−1) +f(3−2) =f(2) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3
f(4) = f(4−1) +f(4−2) =f(3) + f(2) = 3 + 2 = 5
f(5) = f(5−1) +f(5−2) =f(4) + f(3) = 5 + 3 = 8
f(6) = f(6−1) +f(6−2) =f(5) + f(4) = 8 + 5 = 13
Remark 10.1.2
Notice how the numbers follow the Fibonacci sequence. This is because the recursions
for our sequence and the Fibonacci sequence are the same. However, this is not always
the case for all recursion problems.
10.2 Recursion with Constraints
Example 10.1
Jeff is climbing a 7 stair staircase. Jeff can climb 1 or 2 stairs at a time on every step,
but on the last step, he is allowed to climb 3 stairs. In how many distinct ways can he
get to the top?
Video Solution
Concept 10.2.1
T o solve a problem with recursion requires a multi-step process:
1. Solve the problem for a few smaller base cases manually
2. In general, you will need as many base cases as the number of terms on the right
hand side of your recursive function
3. F or a given f(n), figure out a recursive equation in terms of previous values of the
function by considering different ways to get to that point
134
Chapter 10. Recursion
4. Iteratively calculate values of f(n)until you reach the desired number
Remark 10.2.2
Y ou can also use f(0) = 1 as a base case because to get to the 0th stair, you have to
take no steps and there is only 1 way to do so. This can be a little faster, however it
could be a little confusing, so it won’t be used in the examples. Nevertheless, feel free
to use it in the problems section.
Example 10.2
Mike is climbing a staircase with 10 stairs. He is in a rush, so he will climb 2 or 3 steps
at a time for most of the journey . If he reaches the 9th stair, he is allowed to climb 1
stair to reach the 10th stair. How many ways are there for Mike to reach the top of the
staircase?
Solution 10.2
W e can do a similar approach to the previous problem. W e first begin by finding the base
cases.
There is no way to reach the 1st stair since he cannot take a 1 step, so f(1) = 0 .
There is 1 way to reach the 2nd stair by taking a double step, so f(2) = 1 .
There is 1 way to reach the 3rd stair by taking a triple step. If the first step is a double step,
then it’s impossible to reach the 3rd stair since there are no single steps. Therefore, f(3) = 1 .
Next, what is the recursive function for this problem?
T o get the the nth stair, we must either take a 2 step from the (n−2)th stair or a 3
step from the (n−3)th stair. So, the recursion is
f(n) =f(n−2) +f(n−3)
Let’s now evaluate the values of f(n)
f(1) = 0
f(2) = 1
f(3) = 1
f(4) = f(4−2) +f(4−3) =f(2) + f(1) = 1
f(5) = f(5−2) +f(5−3) =f(3) + f(2) = 2
f(6) = f(6−2) +f(6−3) =f(4) + f(3) = 2
f(7) = f(7−2) +f(7−3) =f(5) + f(4) = 3
f(8) = f(8−2) +f(8−3) =f(6) + f(5) = 4
f(9) = f(9−2) +f(9−3) =f(7) + f(6) = 5
135
Chapter 10. Recursion
f(10) = f(10−2) +f(10−3) =f(8) + f(7) = 7
So, is our answer just f(10) = 7 ?
No, because once he reaches stair 9, he is allowed to take a single step. So, we must add the
number of ways to reach stair 9 to the number of ways to reach stair 8 and the number of
ways to reach stair 7. Therefore, we must find:
f(10) = f(8) + f(7) + f(9) = 12
Remark 10.2.3
In general, it never hurts to find too many base cases. In your recursion, if you run into
any values you are not sure how to calculate (like f(2), f(3)), you can always go back
and evaluate more base cases.

F or probability recursions, it can be a good idea to simply make a table and find the

Based on this rate of defect, how many total calculators are expected to be defective?
Solution 11.1
Let’s approach this problem one step at a time.
What fraction of the total calculators were tested?
F or each crate, 12 out of 144 calculators were tested, so1
12of them were tested.
F rom this, how many total calculators are expected to be defective?
W e can think of dividing the calculators into 12 groups. Each group will make up1
12of

What percentage of the total marbles have a special design?
Solution 11.2
W e can approach this problem by finding the percentage of ”large yellow” and ”small green”
marbles.
What percent of marbles are large and yellow?
Since 40% of the marbles are large and 10% of the large marbles are yellow, 10%×40% =
142
Chapter 11. Ratios and Percentages
1
10×40% = 4% of the marbles are large and yellow.
What percent of marbles are small and green?
Since 20% of the marbles are small and 40% of the small marbles are green, 20%×40% =
1
5×40% = 8% of the marbles are small and green.
F rom this, what percent of marbles have a special design?
A total of 4% + 8% = 12% of marbles are large and yellow or small and green. Therefore,
since half of them have a special design,1
2×12% = 6% have a special design.

10 workers from a company each working at a constant rate can build 10 houses in 12
years. However, after 6 years, 5 of them retire. The other workers continue working at
the same original rate. The project is falling behind, so 2 years later, the company hires
10 more workers who each work twice as fast as the original workers. After how many
total years will the 10 houses be complete?
Solution 11.3
T o solve this problem, we will have to use ratios to compare the amount of work being done.
After 6 years, what fraction of the 10 houses will be built?
Since 6 years is half of the time needed to build 10 houses,1
2of the houses will be com-
pleted by 6 years.
Next, we can see that for 2 years, only 5 of the original workers are working.
In these 2 years, what fraction of the houses will be built?
2 years is1
6of the time needed to build all of the houses. However, only1
2of the origi-
nal workers are working. Therefore, in total,1
2×1
6=1
12of the houses will be built in these
2 years.
Next, we must find the rate of building houses when the 10 workers are added.
Compared to the original rate, how fast do the 5 original and 10 new work-
ers work?
Since each of the 10 new workers work 2 times faster than one of the original workers, the 5
original workers that remain and the 10 new workers can do as much work as 5+10 ×2 = 25
original workers. Therefore, with the addition of the new workers, they can work25

times faster.

How long will it take the new team of workers to build5

The 10 original workers built1
2of the houses in 6 years, the remaining 5 original work-

12.1 System of Equations Basics
Concept 12.1.1 (F actoring a Quadratic)
If we have a quadratic of the form x2+bx+c, it can be factored into (x+p)(x+q)such
thatp+q=bandpq=c. W e can generally do this by guess and check.
Then, we just solve the linear equations of the form x+r= 0 .
Concept 12.1.2 (Vietas F ormulas)
If we have a quadratic of the form x2+bx+cwith 2 roots rands, then r+s=−band
rs=c. Sometimes, you may not need to calculate the roots and just find expression in
terms of the roots.
Theorem 12.1.3 (Quadratic F ormula)

2. Substituting V ariables
3. Elimination
4. Adding/Subtracting/Multiplying Equations
5. Difference of Squares: x2−y2= (x−y)(x+y)
6. Binomial Expansions:

(x−y)2=x2−2xy+y2
7. Other common factorization tricks (see algebraic number theory chapter for more)
8. Squaring equations if you have square roots

Solution 12.1
This is a classic equation problem that uses a very powerful technique.
Do you notice anything similar about the equations?
Indeed! All 3 equations have 2 of one of the variables x,y,z and 1 of the other 2 vari-
ables. So, the equations are symmetric!
How can we use the symmetry?
Let’s rewrite the equations as follows:
x+ (x+y+z) = 36
y+ (x+y+z) = 40
z+ (x+y+z) = 32
Notice how each equation simply consists of the sum x+y+zplus an additional x,y, or
z. The sum x+y+zreoccurs in every equation.
How can we make another x+y+zterm?
W e can add all 3 equations together!. This will give us
(x+y+z) + 3( x+y+z) = 4( x+y+z) = 36 + 40 + 32 = 108
. This simplifies to x+y+z= 27 .

Example 13.1
Joe needs to get to his oﬀice 40 miles away . If he drives at 60 miles per hour, how many
minutes will it take him to get to work?
Solution 13.1
This problem is just a direct application of the speed, distance, and time formula.
What information do we know?
The distance is 40 miles. The speed is 60 miles per hour.
How can we calculate the number of minutes?
The number of minutes, a measure of time, can be calculated by dividing distance by speed
which is40miles
60miles per hour=2
3hours.
How many minutes will it take?
The time we calculated was in hours because the speed was given in miles per hour, so
we multiply by 60 to2

A common mistake is to assume that average speed is the averages of all speeds (es-

Remember, that’s not true unless you are traveling at those speeds for the same amount
of time!
Remark 13.1.4
Often, we may have to form equations with distance, speed, and time and use them to
solve our problem.

14.1 Arithmetic Sequences
Definition 14.1.1 (Arithmetic Sequence) .An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers
with the same difference between consecutive terms.
1,4,7,10,13,...,40
is an arithmetic sequence because there is always a difference of 3between consecutive terms.
Remark 14.1.2
Note that an arithmetic sequence can also have a negative common difference. F or
example, in the arithmetic sequence
40,37,34,...,4,1
the common difference is −3.
Definition 14.1.3 (Arithmetic Sequence Notation) .In general, the terms of an arithmetic
sequence can be represented as:
a1,a2,a3,a4,...,a n
where
•dis the common difference between consecutive terms
•nis the number of terms
Theorem 14.1.4 (nth term in an Arithmetic Sequence)
an=a1+ (n−1)d
which basically means the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is equal to
first term + ( number of terms −1)( common difference )
W e also have that
an=am+ (n−m)d
which means
the nth term =mth term + ( number of terms −m)(common difference )

Definition 14.3.1 (Geometric Sequence) .A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers
with the same ratio between consecutive terms.
1,2,4,8,16,32...,1024
is a geometric sequence because there is always a ratio of 2 between consecutive terms.
Definition 14.3.2 (Geometric Sequence Notation) .In general, the terms of a geometric
sequence can be represented as:
g1,g2,g3,g4,...,g n
where
•ris the common ratio between consecutive terms
•nis the number of terms
Remark 14.3.3
Note that a geometric sequence can also have a negative common ratio. F or example
the sequence 1,−2,4,−8,...,512,−1024 has a common ratio of −2.

T o solve this, we will apply the formulas above.
What is the first step we should do to make analyzing the numbers easier?
W e should order them! Doing so, we end up with 1,1,2,3,5,7,9.
What is the mean?
The mean is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of numbers. The sum of numbers
is1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 28 . There are 7 numbers. Therefore, the mean is28
7= 4 .
What is the median?
There are 7 numbers, so the median will just be the middle, or 4th number when the
numbers are arranged in increasing order. The 4th number is 3, so the median is also 3.
What is the mode?
The only number that appears more than once is 1, so 1 is the mode.
What is the range?
The range will be the largest number, 9, minus the smallest number, 1, which is equal
to9−1 = 8 .
Therefore, the sum of the mean, median, mode, and range is 1 + 3 + 4 + 8 = 16 .

A list of 6 distinct positive integers has a mean of 7, a median of 6, and a range of 9.
Find the sum of the 2nd and 5th smallest numbers.
Solution 15.2
This problem may seem a little tricky because of how many possibilities there are. Let’s first
focus on the median, as there only a few cases which work.
What are the possibilities for the middle 2 numbers, or the 3rd and 4th smallest
numbers?
The average of these 2 numbers must be 6, or the sum must be 2×6 = 12 .
What must be the sum of the remaining 4 numbers?
The mean of all 6 numbers is 7, so their sum is 6×7 = 42 . The sum of the middle 2
numbers is 12, so the sum of the remaining 4 numbers must be 42−12 = 30 .
Next, let’s consider the cases for the 2 middle numbers that result in a sum of 12. The
following possibilities exist:
Case 1: 3rd smallest number: 6, 4th smallest number 6
This is not possible because the numbers are distinct.
194
Chapter 15. Mean, Median, Mode
Case 2: 3rd smallest number: 4, 4th smallest number 8
In this case, there are very few possibilities for the lowest 2 numbers. Since they must
be positive, less than 4, and distinct, the only possibilities are (1,2), (1,3), and (2, 3). In
addition, the range must also be 9. Therefore, the largest number will be the lowest number
plus the range, which can be 1 + 9 = 10 or2 + 9 = 11 . W e can consider each of the cases for
the largest and smallest numbers, however, we should first check if this case is even possible.
Is it possible for the sum of the 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 6th smallest numbers to
be 30 in this case?
W e can consider each of the cases for the largest and smallest numbers, however, we should
first check if having a mean of 7 is even possible. The largest number can be at most 11, and
the 2nd largest number can be at most 10 since it can’t be the same as the largest number.
This means the sum of these 4 numbers can be at most 2+3+10+11 = 26 , which isn’t large
enough to be 30. Therefore, this case doesn’t work.
Case 3: 3rd smallest number 3, 4th smallest number 9
The smallest 2 numbers must be 1 and 2, since all of the numbers must be positive and
less than 3. Then, by similar logic to the previous case, the largest value is 1 + 9 = 10 . The
2nd largest value can be at most 9. This means the sum is at most 1+2+9+10 = 22 , which
is again, not large enough.
Case 4: 3rd smallest number 2 or 1, 4th smallest number 10 or 11, respectively
F or the other cases, the 3rd smallest number will be less than 3. However, we must have 2
distinct positive values less than the 3rd smallest number (the 1st and 2nd smallest numbers).
W e can see that if the 3rd smallest value is less than 3 and is 1 or 2, then there are 0 or 1
distinct positive values less than this number. Therefore, these cases don’t work. Case 5:
3rd smallest number: 5, 4th smallest number 7
Is it possible for the smallest number to be 2?
Let’s see if it’s possible for the sum of smallest 2 numbers and largest 2 numbers to be
30 in this case. The largest possible value for the 2nd smallest number is 4, since it has
to be less than 5. The largest number must be the smallest number plus the range, which
is2 + 9 = 11 , and the 2nd largest number can be at most 10. Therefore, sum of smallest
2 numbers and largest 2 numbers is at most 2 + 4 + 10 + 11 = 27 . Therefore, the smallest
number cannot be 2.
If the smallest number is 1, the sum will be even lower since the largest will be 10, and
the 2nd largest number will be at most 9. This would result in a sum even lower than in the
195
Chapter 15. Mean, Median, Mode
previous possibility .
Therefore, the smallest number must be 3, and since the 2nd smallest number has to be
greater than the smallest number (3) and less than the 3rd smallest number (5), it must be
4. In addition, the largest number will be 3+9 = 12 . Then, let the 2nd largest number be x.
What value of x will result in the sum smallest 2 numbers and largest 2 numbers
being 30?
Adding all of these numbers, we get that this sum is 3+4+12+ x= 30 . This means that the
2nd largest number is 11. This case works because this number is smaller than the largest
number (12), and larger than the 4th smallest number (7).
The 6 numbers (in increasing order) are 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, 12 satisfy all 3 conditions. The
sum of the 2nd and 5th smallest numbers are 4 + 11 = 15 .

Chapter 17. Primes and Divisibility
17.1 Primes
Definition 17.1.1 (Primes) .Primes are numbers that have exactly two factors: 1 and the
number itself.
Example: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 are all primes
Note: 1 is not a prime and 2 is the only even prime.
Remark 17.1.2
It’s highly recommended to memorize first few primes as this can save some time during
the contest: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37
Remark 17.1.3
In order to check whether a number nis prime, we need to check whether it can be
divided by all the primes that are less than or equal to√n
17.2 Divisibility Rules
Here are some important rules to figure out whether a number is divisible by another num-
ber.
Divisibility rule for 2: Last digit is even
Example: 362
The last digit is even, so 362 is divisible by 2.
Divisibility rule for 3: Sum of digits is divisible by 3
Example: 972
The sum of digits is 9 + 7 + 2 = 18, which is a multiple of 3
Divisibility rule for 4: The number formed by the last 2 digits is divisible by 4
Example: 172947
The number formed by last two digits is 47 which is not divisible by 4, so 172947 is also not
divisible by 4
Example: 10764
The number formed by last two digits is 64 which is divisible by 4, so 10764 is divisible by
4
213
Chapter 17. Primes and Divisibility
Divisibility rule for 5 - Last digit is 0 or 5
Example: 375
The last digit is 5, so 375 is divisible by 5.
Example: 140
The last digit is 0, so 140 is divisible by 5.
Divisibility rule for 6: The number is divisible by both 2 and 3
Example: 196
The last digit is 2, so 196 is divisible by 2. The sum of digits is 1 + 9 + 6 = 16, which is
not a multiple of 3, so 196 is not a multiple of 3. Therefore, 196 is also not a multiple of 6.
Example: 252
The last digit is 2, so 252 is divisible by 2. The sum of digits is 2 + 5 + 2 = 9, which is a
multiple of 3, so 196 is a multiple of 3. Therefore, 196 is also a multiple of 6.
Divisibility rule for 7: T ake out factors of 7 until you reach a small number
that is either divisible or not divisible by 7
Example: 2240
W e subtract 2100, which is divisible by 7 ( 7×300 ) to get 2240 - 2100 = 140. Then, we see
that 140 is also divisible by 7 as it is 7×20. Therefore, 2240 is also divisible by 7.
Example: 28146
W e subtract 28000, which is divisible by 7 ( 7×4000 ) to get 28146 - 28000 = 146. Then, we
subtract 140 as it is also divisible by 7 to get 6. 6 is clearly not divisible by 7, so 28146 is
also not divisible by 7.
Divisibility rule for 8: The number formed by the last 3 digits is divisible by 8
Example: 423824
The number formed by the last 3 digits is 824 which is divisible by 8 ( 8×103 ), so 423824 is
also divisible by 8.
Example: 4827676 The last 3 digits are 676. Using the same technique that we used
to find numbers divisible by 7, we can subtract off numbers divisible by 8. Clearly , 640 is
divisible by 8 ( 8×80), so subtracting that off, we get 676−640 = 36 . Then, we can subtract
off8×4 = 32 to get 4. W e know that 4 is not divisible by 8. Therefore, 4827676 is also not
divisible by 8.
214
Chapter 17. Primes and Divisibility
Divisibility rule for 9: Sum of digits is divisible by 9
Example: 63198
The sum of digits is 6+3+1+9+8 = 27 , which is divisible by 9, so 63198 is also divisible by 9.
Example: 815419 The sum of digits is 8 + 1 + 5 + 4 + 1 + 9 = 28 , which is not divisible
by 9, so 63198 is not divisible by 9.
10 - Last digit is 0
Example: 331960
The last digit is 0, so 331960 is divisible by 10.
Divisibility rule for 11: Calculate the sum of odd positioned digits (O) and
even positioned digits (E). If O - E is divisible by 11, then the number is also
divisible by 11. Don’t forget that O - E can be negative.
Example: 1331 First, we calculate the sum of the odd positioned digits, or the sum of
the 1st and 3rd digits from the left. W e find O= 1 + 3 = 4 .
Next, we calculate the sum of the even positioned digits, or the sum of the 2nd and 4th
digits from the left. W e find E= 3 + 1 = 4 .
The difference of numbers, O−E= 4−4 = 0 , and 0 is a multiple of 11, so 1331 is divis-
ible by 11.
Example: 629321
First, we calculate the sum of the odd positioned digits, or the sum of the 1st, 3rd, and 5th
digits from the left. W e find O= 6 + 9 + 2 = 17 . Next, we calculate the sum of the even
positioned digits, or the sum of the 2nd, 4th, and 6th digits. W e find E= 2 + 3 + 1 = 6 .
The difference O−E= 17−6 = 11 , which is clearly a multiple of 11, so 629321 is divisi-
ble by 11.
Divisibility rule for 12: Divisible by 3 and 4
Example: 1584
First, we check if 1584 is divisible by 3. The sum of digits is 1 + 5 + 8 + 4 = 18 , which is
divisible by 3, so 1584 is divisible by 3.
Next, we check if 1584 is divisible by 4. The last 2 digits, 84, is divisible by 4, so 1584
is also divisible by 4.
215
Chapter 17. Primes and Divisibility
Therefore, 1584 is divisible by 12 since it is divisible by both 3 and 4.
Example: 230792
First, we check if 230792 is divisible by 3. The sum of digits is 2 + 3 + 0 + 7 + 9 + 2 = 23 ,
which is not divisible by 3, so 1584 is not divisible by 3.
Next, we check if 230792 is divisible by 4. The last 2 digits, 92, is divisible by 4, so 230792
is divisible by 4.
Although 230792 is divisible by 4, it is not divisible by 3, so therefore cannot be divisi-
ble by 12.
Divisibility rule for 15: Divisible by 3 and 5
Example: 352305
First, we check if 352305 is divisible by 3. The sum of digits is 3 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 5 = 18 ,
which is divisible by 3, so 352305 is not divisible by 3.
Next, we check if 352305 is divisible by 5. The last digits, 5, is divisible by 5, so 235305 is
also divisible by 5.
Therefore, 352305 is divisible by 15 since it is divisible by both 3 and 5.
Example: 374740
First, we check if 374740 is divisible by 3. The sum of digits is 3 + 7 + 4 + 7 + 4 + 0 = 25 ,
which is not divisible by 3, so 374740 is not divisible by 3.
Next, we check if 374740 is divisible by 5. The last digit, 0, is divisible by 5, so 374740
is also divisible by 5.
Although 374740 is divisible by 5, it is not divisible by 3, so it cannot be divisible by 15.

are powers of a prime number like 35or24), then it will also be divisible by their product.
F or example, to find whether a number is divisible by 30 = 2 ×3×5, we just need

Find the prime factorization of 117.
Solution 17.1
First, let’s check if 117 is divisible by any small primes. Clearly , 117 is odd and not divisible
by 2.
Is 117 divisible by 3?
W e can see that since the sum of digits is 9, a multiple of 3, the number is divisible by
3. In fact, since 9 is also a multiple of 9, the number is also divisible by 9 or 32.
Dividing by 32we get117
9= 13 . Clearly , 13 is prime.
Therefore, our prime factorization is 32×13.

Solution 17.2
W e can use our knowledge of divisibility rules to solve this.
F or a number to be divisible by 15, what other numbers must it be divisible
by?
W e can see that 15 = 3 ×5, so for a number to be divisible by 15, it must also be divisi-
ble by 3 and 5. In order to solve this problem, we will look at the divisibility rule for 3 and
5.
Which divisibility rule should we look at first?
If we look at the divisibility rule for 3 first, we will end with many possibilities for AandB.
On the other hand, what does the divisibility rule for 5 tell us?
The divisibility rule for 5 tells us that B must be 0 or 5. This is much easier to use than
the divisibility rule for 3 as now, we only have 2 possibilities to consider. Because we have
already checked for the divisibility of 5, we must now check if the number is divisible by 3.
Case 1: B = 0
IfB= 0, then the number will be A30. F or this number to be divisible by 3, A+3+0 = A+3
must be divisible by 3. Because 3 is a multiple of 3, Amust also be a multiple of 3. Therefore,
Ahas 3 possibilities and can be 3, 6, or 9. The digit Acan’t be 0 since it has to be a 3 digit
219
Chapter 17. Primes and Divisibility
number. This gives the following possible numbers: 330, 630, 930.
Case 1: B = 5
IfB= 5, then the number will be A35. F or this number to be divisible by 3, A+3+5 = A+8
must be divisible by 3. Because 8 leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, A must leave
a remainder of 1 when divided by 3 for the sum to be a multiple of 3. Therefore, A has
3 possibilities and can be 1, 4, or 7. This gives the following possible numbers: 135, 435, 735.
Summing all numbers, we get
330 + 630 + 930 + 135 + 435 + 735 = 3195
Example 17.3 (Omega Learn)
The number 3AB76 is divisible by 264, where A andB are digits. Find A+B.
Solution 17.3
Let’s see how we can approach this problem.
F orAnumber to be divisible by 264, what other numbers must it be divisible by?
T o figure this out, we first find the prime factorization of 264.
First, we divide out by powers of 2. Doing this repeatedly we get 264 = 2 ×132 = 22×66 =
23×33
Then, we can notice that the sum of digits of 33 is 3 + 3 = 6 , which is a multiple of 3, so
33 is a multiple of 3. Dividing by 3, we are then left with 11, which is clearly a prime number.
Therefore, the prime factorization is 23×3×11. Therefore, for the number to be divisi-
ble by 264, it must be divisible by 23(= 8) , 3, and 11.
First, what information does 3AB76 being divisible by 8 give us?
By the divisibility rule for 8, the last 3 digits, or B76, must be divisible by 8. Notice
that 76 leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8. Therefore, B = 0 doesn’t work.
When B is 1, then we are adding 100 to the last 3 digits. 100 also leaves a remainder
of 4 when divided by 8. So 176 = 176 + 100 will leave a remainder of 4 + 4 = 8 or 0 when
divided by 8, so 176 is divisible by 8.
220
Chapter 17. Primes and Divisibility
Next, we can see that when B is 2, our number will be 276, which is equal to 100 + 176 .
Since 176 is divisible by 8 and 100 leaves Aremainder of 4 when divided by 8, 276 will leave
A remainder of 0 + 4 = 4 when divided by 8.
Do you notice A pattern with the remainders here?
Whenever B is even, it appears that B76 leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8, and
whenever B is odd, B76 is divisible by 8. This is because 176 is divisible by 8, adding 100
will make the remainder 4 when divided by 8. Therefore, by adding 200, the remainder will
become 4 + 4 = 8 or 0. Therefore, only odd values of B work.
Next, what does 3AB76 being divisible by 11 tell us?
Using the divisibility rule for 11, we have that the sum of the odd positioned digits, O=
3+B+6 = 9+ B and the sum of the even positioned digits, E=A+7 . Therefore, O−E=
2 +B−A must be divisible by 11.
What are the possible values for O - E = 2 + B - A?
Let’s suppose it is equal to -11. Then 2 +B−A=−11 which means A−B= 13 . Since
A andB are digits from 0 to 9, this is clearly impossible. Any other negative multiple of 11
such as -22, -33, etc. will also mean that A−B equals something larger than 9.
Next, let’s suppose it is equal to 0. Then 2 +B−A= 0 which means A−B= 2 . Since
we have that B is odd from it being a multiple of 8, the only possibilities are:
1.A = 3,B = 1
2.A = 5,B = 3
3.A = 7,B = 5
4.A = 9,B = 7.
IfB = 9, then A = 11, which is not possible as A needs to be 1 digit.
Finally , let’s suppose O - E is equal to 11. Then 2 +B−A= 11 which means B−A= 9 .
Because A andB are digits from 0 to 9, the only possibility is when A= 0 andB= 9 . Any
other positive multiple of 11 such as 22, 33, etc. will mean that B−A equals something
larger than 9.
How do we use the fact that 3AB76 is a multiple of 3 to finish the problem?

Chapter 17. Primes and Divisibility
Notice how we only have 5 cases, so we can easily manually check if each one is a mul-
tiple of 3 by using its divisibility rule.
Case 1: A = 3, B = 1
F or this case, the number is 33176. The sum of digits is 3 + 3 + 1 + 7 + 6 = 20 , which is
not a multiple of 3, so this case does not work.
Case 2: A = 5, B = 3
F or this case, the number is 35376. The sum of digits is 3 + 5 + 3 + 7 + 6 = 24 , which is
a multiple of 3, so this case does work.
Case 3: A = 7, B = 5
F or this case, the number is 37576. The sum of digits is 3 + 7 + 5 + 7 + 6 = 28 , which is
not a multiple of 3, so this case does not work.
Case 4: A = 9, B = 7
F or this case, the number is 39776. The sum of digits is 3 + 9 + 7 + 7 + 6 = 32 , which is
not a multiple of 3, so this case does not work.
Case 5: A = 0, B = 9
F or this case, the number is 30976. The sum of digits is 3 + 0 + 9 + 7 + 6 = 25 , which is
not a multiple of 3, so this case does not work.
Therefore, A = 5 and B = 3 is the only case that works, so our answer is 5 + 3 = 8 .
Remark 17.3.1
In these types of problems, it’s almost always best to first find the prime factorization
of the number, and then use the divisibility rules for each of the primes or prime powers
in the prime factorization.

Chapter 18. F actors
In this chapter, we will learn about interesting techniques to calculate the number, sum,
and product of factors.
18.1 Number of F actors
Theorem 18.1.1 (Number of F actors of a Number)
If the prime factorization of the number is expressed as:
pe1
1×pe2
2×···× pek
k
then the number of factors of this number is
(e1+ 1)(e2+ 1)...(ek+ 1)
Concept 18.1.2
Basically , in order to find the number of factors of a number:
1. Find the prime factorization of the number
2. Add 1 to all of the exponents
3. Multiply them together
Example 18.1
How many factors does the number 112 have?
Solution 18.1
In order to find how many factors 112 has, we must find the prime factorization of 112.
Clearly , 112 is divisible by 2. W e can repeatedly divide by 2 to get
112 = 2 ×56 = 22×28 = 23×14 = 24×7
Since 7 is prime, there are no further primes to divide, so the prime factorization is 24×71
F rom this, how do find the number of factors of 112?
230
Chapter 18. F actors
W e can simply use the formula shown above to find the number of factors. In the prime
factorization the exponents are 4 and 1. Adding 1 to each of the exponents, we get 5 and 2.
Therefore, the number of factors is 5×2 = 10 .
Concept 18.1.3
Here is a logical way to think about this formula - for each prime pk, the exponent
can be anything from 0 to ek. Therefore, there are ek+ 1 choices. Therefore, the total
number of factors is just the product of all such ek+ 1 terms.
F or example, in 112 = 24×7, in the factor, the power of 2 can be 20,21,22,23,or24.
The power of 7 can be 70or71.
Therefore, in total there would be 5×2 = 10 ways just as we calculated in the pre-
vious problem. This logic will be useful when other conditions are imposed.
Example 18.2
How many positive factors does the number 144 have that are perfect squares?
Solution 18.2
First, we begin by finding the prime factorization of 144.
W e first divide by factors of 2. This gives us 144 = 21×72 = 22×36 = 23×18 = 24×9.
9 is simply 32, so our prime factorization is 24×32. Unlike the last problem, we can’t just
directly apply the number of factors formula.
How can we deal with the condition that the factor must be a perfect square?
F or a number to be a perfect square, all primes in the prime factorization must be even.
Let’s try to find the number of exponents possible for each prime to form a perfect square
factor.
How many choices are there for the exponent of the prime 2 in the prime factor-
ization?
F or the number to be a square, the exponent must be even and between 0 to 4. It can
be either 0, 2, or 4. Therefore, we have 3 choices.
How many choices are there for the exponent of the prime 3 in the prime factor-
ization?
231
Chapter 18. F actors
Similarly , the exponent for 3 must be even and from 0 to 2, so it can be either 0, or 2.
Therefore, we have 2 choices.
Therefore, in total, 144 has 3×2 = 6 perfect square factors.
Example 18.1 (AMC 8)
How many positive integer factors of 2020 have more than 3factors? (As an example,
12 has6factors, namely 1,2,3,4,6,and12.)
Video Solution
18.2 Sum of F actors
Theorem 18.2.1 (Sum of F actors of a Number)
If the prime factorization of the number is expressed as:
pe1
1×pe2
2×···× pek
k
then the number of factors of this number is
(1+p1
1+p2
1+···+pe1−1
1+pe1
1)(1+p1
2+p2
2+···+pe2−1
2+pe2
2)...(1+p1
k+p2
k+···+pek−1
k+pek
k)
Concept 18.2.2 (Sum of F actors of a Number)
Essentially , for a prime p in the prime factorization, first find the sum of pkfor all
possible exponents k in the prime factorization. Then, we will multiply all such sums
for all of the primes to get the sum of all the factors of the number. This may seem
complicated, but it will make more sense with an example
Example 18.3
What is the sum of factors of 112?
232
Chapter 18. F actors
Solution 18.3
W e can calculate that the prime factorization of 112 = 24×7. W e will find the sum of powers
of 2 and powers of 7.
What is the sum of powers of 2?
The exponent of 2 can be anything from 0 to 4. Therefore, the sum of powers of 2 is
20+ 21+ 22+ 23+ 24= 31 .
Similarly , the sum of powers of 7 is 70+ 71= 8 .
Therefore, the sum of factors of 112 will be the product of both of our sums, which is
31×8 = 248 .
18.3 Product of F actors
Theorem 18.3.1 (Product of F actors of a Number)
The product of factors of a number n where it has f factors (this can be calculated using
the number of factors formula) is nf
2
Example 18.4
Find the product of the factors of 20.
Solution 18.4
First, we must find the number of factors of 20, as this is needed in the formula. T o do this,
we must first find the prime factorization of 20.
W e first divide by powers of 2. W e have that 20 = 21×10 = 22×5 = 22×51. Since 5 is
prime, this is the prime factorization of 20.
F rom here, how many factors does 20 have?
W e simply add 1 to each exponent to get 3 and 2. The number of factors will be the
product, which is 3×2 = 6 .
Then, we have to apply the formula to get the product of factors. F rom above, we have
233
Chapter 18. F actors
that the number of factors f= 6 . Also, we have that the number n= 20 . Plugging this into
the formula, we get 206
2= 203= 8000

19.1 GCD and LCM F undamentals
Definition 19.1.1 (Greatest Common Divisor) .The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of
two or more integers (which are not all zero) is the largest positive integer that divides each
of the integers.
Note: This is also known as GCF (Greatest Common F actor), and the terms GCF and GCD
are often used interchangeably .
Definition 19.1.2 (Least Common Multiple) .The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two
or more integers (which are not all zero) is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by
both the numbers.
Concept 19.1.3
Greatest common divisor of m and n =GCD (m,n)can be found by taking the lowest
prime exponents from the prime factorizations of m and n.
Least common multiple of m and n =LCM (m,n)can be found by taking the highest
prime exponents from the prime factorizations of m and n.

19.2 GCD and LCM Product
Theorem 19.2.1
The product of GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the two
numbers:
GCD (m,n)×LCM (m,n) =m×n
Remark 19.2.2
Let’s explore the reason why this is true. Let’s say that m has pain it’s prime factor-
ization, and n has pbin it’s prime factorization. Then, the product mn will have pa+b
in it’s prime factorization.
240
Chapter 19. GCD and LCM
Remember from above how the gcd can be found by taking the lowest prime expo-
nents and the lcm can be found by taking the highest prime exponents.
Therefore, if a is smaller than b, than the gcd will have pain it’s prime factorization,
and the lcm will have pbin it’s prime factorization. On the other hand, if b is smaller
than a, than the gcd will have pbin it’s prime factorization, and the lcm will have pain
it’s prime factorization.
Therefore, no matter what, the product of the gcd and lcm will have pa+bin it’s prime
factorization. This is true for all primes, so the products are equal.
Example 19.1
Suppose we have 2 numbers m and n such that mn= 1260 andLCM (m,n) = 210 . Find
GCD (m,n).
Solution 19.1
W e know the product and lcm of the numbers, we can use the identity that
gcd(m,n)×lcm(m,n) =m×n
.
Then, we can simply plug in the given values to get gcd(m,n)×210 = 1260 . Dividing both
sides by 210 gives gcd(m,n) = 6 .

where x > y andkis a positive integer.
Example 19.2
Find the GCD of 186 and 92.
Solution 19.2
W e can apply the Euclidean Algorithm multiple times to easily find the GCD of large numbers
since after applying the Euclidean algorithm, we will have two smaller numbers, and we can
repeatedly apply the Euclidean Algorithm again until we get two very small numbers.
gcd(186 ,92) = gcd((186 −(2·92)),92)
= gcd(2 ,92)
= gcd(2 ,(92−(2·46)))
= gcd(2 ,0)
= 2

Chapter 19. GCD and LCM
Example 19.3 (Omega Learn)
3 numbers a, b, and c satisfy the conditions that gcd(a,b) = 4 ,gcd(b,c) = 18 , and
lcm(a,c) = 144 . Find the value of a+c.
Solution 19.3
T o solve this problem, let’s first figure out how to use the gcd conditions.
What must be true about a and b if gcd(a,b) = 4?
Ifgcd(a,b) = 4 , then both a and b must be multiples of 4.
Similarly , if gcd(b,c) = 18 , then both b and c must be multiples of 18.
What do both of these conditions combined tell us about b?
If b is a multiple of 4 and a multiple of 18, it also must be a multiple of the least com-
mon multiple of 4 and 18 by the above theorem. This means b is a multiple of 36. The
reason this is true is because to be a multiple of 18, it must also be as multiple of 9 and 2.
However, a number that is a multiple of 4 is already a multiple of 2, so therefore it just has
to be a multiple of 9×4 = 36 .
W e know that a must be a multiple of 4. What happens if a is also a multi-
ple of 3, or even 9?
Keep in mind that gcd(a,b) = 4 means that not only both numbers share a factor of 4,
but that no other factors are shared between the numbers. F rom earlier, we know that b is
a multiple of 36. Therefore, if a has any factors of 3, then the gcd will also have factors of 3
since both a and b would then have factors of 3.
Therefore, a cannot have any factors of 3.
Similarly , what must be true about c?
W e know c is a multiple of 18, which means it’s a multiple of 9 and a multiple of 2. On
the other hand, b is a multiple of 36. The gcd is 18, so if c is a multiple of 36, then the
gcd would have been 36, which is not possible. Therefore, c cannot be a multiple of 36. W e
already know c is a multiple of 9, that means c is not a multiple of 4.
Finally , how do we use the condition that lcm(a,c) = 144 ?
243
Chapter 19. GCD and LCM
First, let’s find the prime factorization of 144.
First, we divide by factors of 2 to get 144 = 2 ×72 = 22×36 = 23×18 = 24×9. 9 is 32,
so the prime factorization is 24×32.
F orlcm(a,c)to have a factor of 24, how many factors of 2 must a and c each have?
Remember from earlier that c is a multiple of 2, but not a multiple of 4. Therefore, c
has 1 factor of 2. However, for the lcm to have a factor of 24, one of the numbers a or c
must have exactly 4 powers of 2 in the prime factorization since the lcm is found by taking
the maximum powers of each prime in the prime factorization of both numbers. Therefore,
a must have exactly 4 powers of 2. It can’t be more than 4 powers of 2 because then the
lcm would also have more than 4 powers of 2. Also, c is a multiple of 2, but not 4, it will
have exactly 1 power of 2 in it’s prime factorization.
Next, for lcm(a,c)to have a factor of 32, how many factors of 3 must a and
c each have?
Earlier, we found that a has no factors of 3 and c must be a multiple of 9. Therefore, c
must have exactly 2 powers of 3 in it’s prime factorization. Again, it can’t have any more
than 2 powers of 3 since that would result in lcm also having more than 2 powers of 3.
Finally , can either a or c have any other prime factors besides 2 or 3?
If a or c had a factor of 5, 7, or some other prime, then the lcm would also have that
prime in it’s prime factorization. But earlier, we found that the prime factorization 24×32
only contains factors of 2 and 3. Therefore, this is impossible.
What are the values of a and c that work?
Since a has 4 powers of 2, no powers of 3, and no powers of any other prime, the prime
factorization is 24. Therefore, a= 16 .
Similarly , since b has 1 power of 2, 2 powers of 3, and no powers of any other prime, the
prime factorization is 2×32. Therefore, b= 18 .
The sum is therefore 16 + 18 = 34 .

Chapter 20. Modular Arithmetic
Solution 20.1
The identity above allows us to simply find each term (mod 1000) and multiply them to-
gether. W e can clearly see that 9≡9 (mod 1000) and99≡99 (mod 1000) .
What is the value of 999 (mod 1000) ?
Since 999 is 1 less than 1000, 999≡ −1 (mod 1000) .
What is the value of 9999 (mod 1000) ?
Notice that 9999 is again 1 less than a multiple of 1000 (10,000), so 9999≡ −1 (mod 1000) .
F or all remaining terms, we can see that since it ends in 999, it will be 1 less than a multiple
of 1000 or −1 (mod 1000) .
In total, amongst all 999 terms, 1 term is 9 (mod 1000) , 1 term is 99 (mod 1000) , and
the 997 remaining terms are all −1 (mod 1000) .
Therefore, the product will be
9×99×(−1)997(mod 1000) ≡891×−1×(−1)996≡−891×((−1)2)498≡−891×1≡109 (mod 1000)

When 19992000is divided by 5, what is the remainder?
250
Chapter 20. Modular Arithmetic
Solution 20.2
W e can simplify our expression by first evaluating 1999 mod 5.
What mod value is equivalent to 1999 (mod 5) ?
1999 leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 5 so we could say that 1999≡4 (mod 5) .
However, then we would still have to calculate the remainder when 42000is divided by 5.
Instead, what negative mod is equivalent to 1999 (mod 5)
Since 1999 is 1 less than 2000, a multiple of 5, we can say that 1999≡ −1 (mod 5) .
Then, we have to find the remainder when −12000is divided by 5, which is
((−1)2)1000= 11000= 1 (mod 5)
so it leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 5.

251
Chapter 20. Modular Arithmetic
Solution 20.3
W e can rewrite our conditions as x≡1 (mod 5) andx≡1 (mod 7) . In order to solve the
problem, we will try to combine these mods in 1 mod statement.
Ifx≡1 (mod 5) andx≡1 (mod 7) , then what is the value of x−1 (mod 5) and
(mod 7) ?
Subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation x≡1 (mod 5) gives us x−1≡0 (mod 5) .
Similarly , we get x−1≡0 (mod 7) . Therefore, x−1is a multiple of both 5 and 7.
Ifx−1is a multiple of both 5 and 7, what else must x−1be a multiple of?
If x - 1 is a multiple of both 5 and 7, x - 1 will also be a multiple of 5×7 = 35 !. Therefore,
we have x−1≡0 (mod 35) orx≡1 (mod 35) .
F rom here, we can see that the possible values less than 100 are 1, 36, 71, 106, etc. Clearly ,
71 is the largest possible value less than 100.

Find the units digit of 21026
252
Chapter 20. Modular Arithmetic
Solution 20.4
1026 is a very large power, so let’s try to find the units digit for smaller powers.
The units digit of 21= 2 is 2.
The units digit of 22= 4 is 4.
The units digit of 23= 8 is 8.
The units digit of 24= 16 is 6.
The units digit of 25= 32 is 2.
The units digit of 26= 64 is 4.
The units digit of 27= 128 is 8.
The units digit of 28= 256 is 6.
Do you see a pattern?
W e can see that the units digit cycle! In fact, they cycle for every 4 powers of 2 in the
pattern 2, 4, 8, 6. After that, the units digit repeat in the same pattern.
How can we use this to find the units digit of 21026?
Since it repeats every 4, we have that 21026≡21022≡21018...(mod 1)0 . W e can see that
since 1026 is 2 (mod 4) , eventually by continuously going down by 4 exponents we will have
that 21026≡22≡4 (mod 1)0 . Therefore, the units digit is 4.

Chapter 21. Diophantine Equations
Concept 21.0.1
Diophantine equation problems often involve having to rewrite numbers and expressions
into variables and combining the use of algebra and number theory . Essentially , they
are equations with integer solutions.
Example 21.1 (Omega Learn)
The digits of a 3 digit number are reversed. The original number is 594 greater than
the new number. What is the largest possible value for the original number?
Solution 21.1
T o start, we will first try and write the problem algebraically .
How can we convert a 3 digit number to variables?
Let the hundredths digit be h, the tens digit t, and units digit u(the 3 digit number will be
htu ). Then, the 3 digit number is essentially 100h+ 10t+u.
What is the number in terms of h, t, and u when the digits are reversed?
Since the original hundreds digit, h, is now the units digit and the original units digit,
u, is now the hundreds digit, the new number will be uth . This is essentially 100u+10t+h.
Now, how do we use the condition that the original number is 594 greater than
the new number?
F or this to happen, we must have
594 = (100 h+ 10t+u)−(100u+ 10t+h)
= (100 h−h) + (10 t−10t) + (u−100h)
= 99h−99u
= 99( h−u)
Dividing both sides by 99 gives h−u= 6 .
What are the possibilites for t?
Notice how tis not part of the condition after simplifying, so it can be any digit.
259
Chapter 21. Diophantine Equations
What are the possibilites for h and u?
All the digits must be from 0 to 9, so we simply look at the possibilites for h.
Ifh= 9 , then u= 3
Ifh= 8 , then u= 2
Ifh= 7 , then u= 1
Ifh= 6 , then u= 0
These are the only cases because any lower value of hwill result in a negative u, which
is impossible.
What values of h, u, and t will produce the largest number?
Since tcan be anything, we can let t= 9 to make it as large as possible. The largest
values for handuis clearly h= 9 andu= 3 , since it has the largest hundreds and units digit
amongst the cases for handu. Therefore, the largest possible value for the original number
is100h+ 10t+u= 100×9 + 10 ×9 + 3 = 993 .
Example 21.1 (Omega Learn)
The digits of a 2 digit number with tens digit 7 is reversed. The digits of a 3 digit
number with hundreds digit 3 and tens digit 5 is also reversed. The sum of both of the
new reversed numbers is 288 more than the sum of the original 2 numbers. Find the
sum of the 2 original numbers.

How many values of nfrom 1 to 100 make 16n−2×4n+ 1 a multiple of 49?
261
Chapter 21. Diophantine Equations
Solution 21.2
Let’s solve this problem using the formulas we learned above.
Do you notice any of the factorizations in the expression?
W e see the terms 16nand4nin our expression. Notice how 16n= (4n)2. Our expression can
be rewritten as (4n)2−2×(4n) + 1 .
Now we can use the (a−b)2=a2−2ab+b2identity! If we let a= 4nandb= 1 , we can
see that
(4n)2−2×(4n)×1 + 1 = a2−2ab+b2= (a−b)2= (4n−1)2
When is (4n−1)2a multiple of 49?
Since 49 = 72, for (4n−1)2to be a multiple of 72, we must have 4n−1be a multiple of
7.
Do you notice any more identities?
Again, we can notice that 4n= (2n)2. Rewriting our expression this way gives (2n)2−1.
W e can now use difference of squares! W e have that
(2n)2−1 = (2n)2−12= (2n−1)(2n+ 1) .
What must happen for (2n−1)(2n+ 1) to be a multiple of 7?
7 is prime, so either 2n−1or2n+1 must be a multiple of 7. Therefore, 2n≡1,6 (mod 7) .
How can we analyze the values of 2n(mod 7)
Let’s try looking at small values.
20≡1 (mod 7)
21= 20×2≡1×2≡2 (mod 7)
22= 21×2≡2×2≡4 (mod 7)
23= 22×2≡4×2≡1 (mod 7)
24= 23×2≡1×2≡2 (mod 7)
262
Chapter 21. Diophantine Equations
25= 24×2≡2×2≡4 (mod 7)
W e can see a pattern. The values of 2n(mod 7) cycle between 1, 2, and 4.
F rom earlier we must have 2n≡1or6 (mod 7) for the expression to be a multiple of 7,
the only possibility is to have 2n≡1 (mod 7) . F rom the pattern, we can see that this only
happens when nis a multiple of 3.
Therefore, from 1 to 100, there are100
3= 33 multiples of 3.

How can we simplify this problem by removing the denominators?
Notice that the denominators have values of 2, x, and y, so we can multiply by 2xy to
get rid of the fractions. W e end up with 2y+ 2x=xy .
What identity or formula can we use on this simplified equation?
Notice how we have xy ,x, and yterms, so we can use Simon’s F avorite F actoring T rick!
263
Chapter 21. Diophantine Equations
W e can rewrite our equation as xy−2x−2y= 0 . W e must rewrite the left hand side as
something of the form (x+j)(y+k). Remember from the theorem above, the coeﬀicient of
theyterm will be j, and the coeﬀicient of the x term will be k.
Make sure to remember that it’s not the other way around as this can be a common mistake!
Since both coeﬀicients are -2, j and k must also both be -2. Therefore, we can rewrite
as(x−2)(y−2).
Are we adding any extra terms?
This product also ads an extra (−2)×(−2) = 4 term. Therefore, we must also subtract
the extra 4 we added.
Thus, we have (x−2)(y−2)−4 = 0 or(x−2)(y−2) = 4 .
Since the right hand side is positive, we have 2 possibilities: either x−2andy−2are
both positive, or both are negative.
Is it possible for x−2andy−2to be negative.
Since xandymust be positive integers (1 or more), the minimum value of x−2andy−2
can be 1−2 =−1.
Therefore, -1 is the only negative value possible for x−2andy−2. However, this will
result in the product being −1×−1 = 1 , which isn’t 4. So these values don’t work.
Therefore, both x−2andy−2must be positive.
What are the positive possibilities for x−2andy−2?
Since their product is 4, they must be factors of 4. Since 4 = 22, the only possibilities
for 2 positive numbers that have a product of 4 is (20,22),(21,21), and (22,20)since the sum
of the exponents of the powers of 2 must be 2 by the exponent product rule.
W e can evaluate this to be (1,4),(2,2), and (4,1). Therefore, we can split the remain-
ing problem into 3 cases:
Case 1: (1, 4)
F or this case, x−2 = 1 , and y−2 = 4 , sox= 3 andy= 6 . This means that x+y= 3+6 = 9 .
264
Chapter 21. Diophantine Equations
Case 2: (2, 2)
F or this case, x−2 = 2 , and y−2 = 2 , sox= 4 andy= 4 . This means that x+y= 4+4 = 8 .
Case 1: (4, 1)
F or this case, x−2 = 4 , and y−2 = 1 , sox= 6 andy= 3 . This means that x+y= 6+3 = 9 .
Therefore, the distinct possible values of x+yare 9 and 8. The sum of these values is
9 + 8 = 17 .

Example 22.1 (Omega Learn)
Josh has some quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies worth 101 cents. He has a total of
9 coins, at least 1 of each type of coin, how many nickels and dimes does he have?
Solution 22.1
First we should try to handle the limiting condition to make the problem simpler.
Is there any way we can easily simplify our problem and remove the condition
of must having at least 1 of each coin?
W e can simply subtract off the value of 1 quarter, 1 dime, 1 nickel, and 1 penny because he
must have 1 of each coin anyway .
The total value of these coins is 25+10+5+1 = 41 cents. W e are then left with 60 cents to
assign to the rest of the coins. Because we have already used 4 coins, the remaining 5 coins
must have a value of 60 cents.
Is it possible to have no more quarters?
W e can see that having no more quarters is impossible because the maximum value for
any other coin is 10 cents, so the maximum value of 5 coins would be 50 cents, which is less
than 60 cents.
How can we split the remaining possibilities into cases?
Since quarter is the coin worth the most, we can split our problem into cases based on
how many quarters we will use.
274
Chapter 22. Miscellaneous Number Theory
Case 1: 1 more quarter
In this case, the quarter will have a value of 25 cents, so the remaining 4 coins have a
value of 60−25 = 35 cents. Clearly , we can see having 4 dimes will not work. However, 3
dimes along with a nickel results in having a total value of 35 cents. Therefore, this case
works.
Although it’s not necessary , to show that no other cases work, we will look at what happens
if we have more quarters.
Case 2: 2 more quarters
In this the 2 quarters will have a value of 50 cents, so the remaining 3 coins have a value of
60−50 = 10 cents.
W e can clearly see that if we have even 1 dime, it’s impossible for the remaining coins
to have a value of 0 cents. Similarly , having 2 nickels is impossible because that means the
remaining coin will have a value of 0 cents. Therefore, we can have at most 1 nickel.
If we have 1 nickel and the remaining 5 cents worth of coins are pennies, there will be
a total of 1 + 5 = 6 coins, which isn’t allowed. If we have no nickels, there will 10 pennies,
which also isn’t possible for the same reason.
Case 3: 3 more quarters
This is impossible because the total value would be 75 cents, which is above the 60 cents we
need.
Therefore, the only case is when we have 1 additional quarter, 3 additional dimes, and 1
additional nickel. Since we also have the include the 1 penny , 1 nickel, 1 dime, and 1 quarter
we had in the beginning, there will be 4 dimes and 2 nickels.
Therefore, the total number of nickels and dimes is 4 + 2 = 6 .

Sohil has received a new TI-84 Calculator from MA THCOUNTS. He is very excited,
so he enters the following expression 26×35×57into the calculator. On any given
operation, Sohil will divide the number by it’s largest prime factor, p. Then, he will
multiply the number by p−1. He continues this process until he reaches a final number
of 1. How many operations, including the final operation, will it take for this to happen?
Solution 22.2
Let’s analyze this step by step.
T o start, what prime number will divide our number first?
The largest prime number in the prime factorization is 5, so 5 will divide first. Then, we will
have to multiply by 5−1 = 4 or22.
After how many operations will all the factors of 5 be gone?
276
Chapter 22. Miscellaneous Number Theory
Each operation removes 1 power of 5 in the prime factorization, so after 7 operations, in
the prime factorization, all the factors of 5 will be gone.
However, we will also have had to multiply by 4 after each operation. How
does this change the prime factorization?
W e will also have had to multiply by 4 = 22, 7 times, or 214. Therefore, after 7 operations,
in the prime factorization, we will have 14 additional factors of 2. The prime factorization
will therefore be 26×214×35= 220×35.
Now, what prime factor do we have to divide by?
The largest prime factor is clearly 3, so we have to divide by this now, instead of 5. Then,
we will have to multiply by 3−1 = 2 .
W e will need 5 operations to divide by all factors of 3. Doing so, we will also have to
multiply the number by 2, 5 times, or by 25. Therefore, after 5 more operations the prime
factorization will 220×25= 225.
Now, what prime factor do we have to divide by?
Because the only prime factor is 2, we must divide by 2. Doing so, we will also have to
multiply our number by 1, which will not change the number. Therefore, because there are
25 factors of 2, we will have to do the operations 25 more times for the number to become 1.
Therefore, the total number of operations needed is 7 + 5 + 25 = 37 .

• A triangle with 2 angles equal will have their corresponding sides equal and a
triangle with 2 sides equal will have their corresponding angles equal (isosceles
triangle)
• Opposite angles in intersecting lines are equal
• Corresponding angles in parallel lines are equal
• The angle made by the arc at the center of the circle is double the angle made by
the arc at the boundary of the circle
Concept 23.1.2 (Complementary Angle)
Complementary angles are a pair of angles with the sum of 90 degrees
Concept 23.1.3 (Supplementary Angle)
Supplementary angles are a pair of angles with the sum of 180 degrees
Concept 23.1.4 (Intersecting lines)
When two lines intersect, the vertical angles are equal. V ertical angles are each of the
pairs of opposite angles made by two intersecting lines. ”V ertical” in this case means
they share the same V ertex (corner point), not the usual meaning of up-down.

they will form a right angle.
Remark 23.4.10
This property is very useful in circle problems as it allows us to work with right angles.
In addition, another helpful technique is drawing useful radii to various points in your
diagram as that opens up new information to work with.

27.1 Congruent T riangles
Theorem 27.1.1
F or congruent triangles:
1. All the angles of the triangles are same
2. All corresponding sides are equal
3. Area, perimeter, inradius, circumradius, etc. are equal
361
Chapter 27. Similar T riangles
Concept 27.1.2 (Congruence T est)
T wo triangles are congruent if the three angles and sides in the triangle are the same. In
other words, the triangles are the same (not necessarily same orientation). In general,
triangles are congruent if:
• AAS congruence: T wo angles of the triangles are same and the 1 side next to the
2 angles are equal
• SAS Congruence (Side Angle Side): T wo sides are equal and the angle between
the sides are equal
• SSS congruence (Side Side Side): All three sides are congruent
• HL congruence (Hypotenuse Leg): In a right triangle, hypotenuse and leg are
equal
• LL congruence (LL Leg): In a right triangle, the two legs are equal
W arning: SSA is not a valid triangle congruence: if 2 corresponding sides are congruent
and the angle which is not between the 2 congruent sides is equal, then the triangles are
not necessarily congruent

Concept 27.2.1 (Similarity T est)
T wo triangles are similar if the three angles in the triangle are the same. In other words,
the triangles are the same shape multiplied by a scale factor.
In general, triangles are similar if:
• AA similarity: T wo angles of the triangles are same, which basically means that
the third angle will be equal)
• SAS similarity (Side Angle Side): T wo sides are proportional and the angle be-
tween the sides is equal
• SSS similarity (Side Side Side): All three sides are proportional
• HL similarity (Hypotenuse Leg): In a right triangle, the hypotenuse and leg are
363
Chapter 27. Similar T riangles
proportional
• LL similarity (LL Leg): In a right triangle, the two legs are proportional
W arning: SSA does not mean triangles are similar
An easy way to detect similar triangles is if bases of triangles are parallel and the
sides of the triangles are collinear (see figure below)
Theorem 27.2.2

Chapter 28. Area and Length of Complex Shapes
• Divide the shape into “nicer” areas which are easier to calculate
• Extend Lines
– Y ou generally want to extend lines when they form nicer shapes/areas to
work with, such as triangles
• Break up areas
– A common way to do so is to drop altitudes as doing so generally allows you
to form right triangles
Remark 28.3.2
A common technique is to find the area of shapes and then find the area of a shape in
terms of a variable (like altitude, inradius, circumradius, etc.) and then solve for that
variable.

Problem 29.8.10 (BmMT)
Shivani is planning a road trip in a car with special new tires made of solid rubber.
Her tires are cylinders that have width 6 inches and have diameter 26 inches, but need
to be replaced when the diameter is less than 22 inches. The tire manufacturer claims
that 0.12 πcubic inches of its tire will wear away with every single rotation. Assuming
that the tire manufacturer is correct about the wear rate of their tires, and that the tire
maintains its cylindrical shape and width (losing volume by reducing radius), how many
revolutions can each tire make before she needs to replace it?

Additional T echniques and Strategies
30.1 Meta-solving T echniques
Video Lectures
Meta-solving T echniques
Definition 30.1.1. Meta-solving is finding the answer to a problem without actually solving
it.
Remark 30.1.2
These techniques may not work for all problems. These techniques are especially useful
when the problem provides answer choices.
Remark 30.1.3 (Meta-Solving W arning)
Don’t get too carried away with these techniques to the point where you don’t even try
to solve the problem legitimately .
Concept 30.1.4 (Engineering Induction)
Engineering Induction is the process of trying and finding the value to small cases and
assuming it’s true for larger ones.
Steps for Engineering Induction Problems:
1. T ry small cases
2. Look for a pattern amongst those small cases (there may not always be one)
416
Chapter 30. Additional T echniques and Strategies
3. Assume the pattern can continue for larger cases and find the answer
Remark 30.1.5
W e can try to apply engineering induction when we see the values in the problem seem
hard/impossible to compute.
417
Chapter 30. Additional T echniques and Strategies
Concept 30.1.6 (Looking for unique properties of numbers)
Rather than computing the exact answer, we can compute unique properties of your an-
swer choices so that you can eliminate all answer choices that don’t satisfy the property
and so that you will be left with 1 answer choice (or possibly more in which case you
can just guess from the remaining ones)
Some unique properties you can look for in your answer choices and try to compute
are
• Units Digit
• Last 2 digits
• Parity (Even, Odd)
• Perfect square or not one
• Prime/composite
• Modulus (remainders when divided by 3, 4, 5, etc.)
• Denominators of common fractions (or what they must divide)
• Multiples/F actors of numbers
• etc.
Remark 30.1.7
These last 2 properties are especially useful in combinatorics problems as you can easily
find numbers you have to multiply with each other to get your answer.
Concept 30.1.8
Look for the option choices that are the ”odd one out” or that are different from all
others
• Look for outliers (primes, large/small numbers, odd/even numbers, powers of 2,
etc)
Concept 30.1.9 (T rying all the Option choices)
In some problems, you can
• T ry all the option choices into the conditions in the problem
• Look at the conditions in the problem and see which of the option choices could
418
Chapter 30. Additional T echniques and Strategies
work
• etc.
After doing so, you will either have a better guess or exact answer.
Concept 30.1.10 (Elimination of Option Choices)
Tying closely to the previous technique, you can also usually eliminate option choices
based on
• Unique properties of Numbers (See Above)
• How large or small the number must be
Concept 30.1.11 (Estimation of Answer)
Often times in problems (especially geometry) you can easily find an approximate an-
swer and see which of the option choices most closely matches what you got.
In geometry , a common strategy to do so is to mark out areas approximately equal
to those of areas you know.
Concept 30.1.12 (Using F reedom in Problems)
Assuming facts when you have freedom in the problem statement can be very useful.
Essentially , as long as the problem is not telling you ”this fact is not true” (so, whatever
assumption you want to make will satisfy the problem’s conditions) you can assume the
fact is true to simplify your problem and make it really easy to solve.
F or example, if you are asked to find some universal ratio in a triangle and you aren’t
specifically told that the triangle isn’t equilateral, you can just assume the triangle is
equilateral and solve the remaining problem from there.
Remark 30.1.13
Make sure not to assume false information! Be very careful that your assumption can
be true.
In our previous example, if we were told the triangle had 2 sides of length 7 and 8, then
our assumption would be false, so it wouldn’t work then.

30.2 Silly Mistakes
Silly mistakes are very common and can really lower your score on the AMC contests. Here
are some tips on how to avoid the different kinds of silly mistakes:
Concept 30.2.1 (A voiding Arithmetic Errors)
A good way to avoid arithmetic errors is to
• Do your computation 2 ways (e.g. If you have to do 87·93, you can multiply them
with 87 on the top and with 93 on top)
• Be more organized, and write more steps
Concept 30.2.2 (A voiding Mathematical Errors)
An easy way to avoid mathematical errors is to
• Do your work neatly!
• Make boxes on scratch paper per problem
• Don’t skip steps
• Check your work, following the tip above will make it easier to do so
• Do your steps methodically
• T ry to substitute your answer back into the problem (if you can)
• T ry an alternate solution to confirm your answer
• Estimate what the answer has to be, and see if your answer is close to what your
estimate is
Concept 30.2.3 (A void Reading Errors)
Reading the problem wrong is one of the most common mistakes. Often times, you
might forget about important key words like
• inclusive, except
• even, odd
• prime, composite
• integer, natural, real, complex
420
Chapter 30. Additional T echniques and Strategies
• non-negative, positive (Remember, non-negative includes 0 while positive doesn’t)
Some strategies to avoid them are
• After solving the problem, reread at least the question part of the problem to
make sure you are answering what the question asks for!
• Underline key words while reading (you cannot do that if the test is online, but as
an alternative you can take note of the important words on your scratch paper)
Concept 30.2.4 (A void Missing Final Step Errors)
Sometimes in problems, you might be so caught up in moving forward in the test that
you might forget an important step at the end.
F or example, in a problem you might think ”I’ll multiply by 5 to whatever answer I
get” and then you find that answer but forget to multiply by 5. A way to avoid this is:
• W rite ”Remember ... ” big and bold on your scratch or the question paper
Concept 30.2.5 (A void Casework Errors)
Many times, in casework problems you might
• Undercount possibilities
• Overcount possibilities
• Miss edges/extreme cases
Some strategies to avoid them are
• Be methodical in your casework
• Make sure all your cases work
– An easy way to do this is just to try a few examples in your case to see if
they actually work
– Especially , make sure to check if extremes work
– Make sure all your cases are disjoint and that you are not overcounting
anything that’s common between the cases
– Make sure your cases cover all possibilities that the problem asks for
421
Chapter 30. Additional T echniques and Strategies
– Solve the problem in multiple ways (for example, by both casework and
complementary counting)
Remark 30.2.6
I know that some of these strategies may take a lot of extra time to follow so we
recommend analyzing how you are making silly mistakes and from there see which
strategies you will want to follow.

30.3 Other Strategies T o Maximize Y our Score
Concept 30.3.1 (Plan Y our Time)
Make sure to plan your time.
• Questions 1-10 are generally easy , 11-20 are medium, 21-25 are hard
• Sometimes one of the early questions can be hard or bashy , or a later question can
be easy
• Don’t get stuck on a question. Move on and come back to it later.
• Star any question you are unsure about but you feel you can solve it, or any
questions that you solved but are not confident of your answer
• Budget your time properly
• Leave enough time for last 10 problems
• Leave some time to review starred problems and check your work
Concept 30.3.2 (Guessing Strategies)
If you want to guess, make sure to keep these things in mind:
• T ry using meta-solving strategies above
• In AMC 8, there is no penalty for guessing, so remember to make an educated
guess for every problem
Concept 30.3.3 (T est Day Strategies)
Here are some test day strategies:
• Don’t try to cram or study on the day before the test
– Just review a few formulas or strategies from this book
• Be relaxed
– Get a good night’s sleep
– Eat a healthy meal
– Meditate
– Eat dark chocolate
423
Chapter 30. Additional T echniques and Strategies
– Listen to music
– Or whatever else makes you feel relaxed
Concept 30.3.4 (Problem Solving Strategies)
T ry to remember these problem solving strategies:
• When you are stuck, try to use the information in the problem you haven’t used
yet
• When solving a problem, think of what technique would likely be at play
• Don’t get too stuck with one approach to a problem, move on, and come back to
the problem with a fresh perspective
• In problems that seem complex, try small cases to look for a pattern that can
allow you to figure out how to approach the problem and what patterns may exist
(this is similar to engineering induction)
Remark 30.3.5
Last, but most important, don’t stress out too much about how you will do! It’s just a
math contest, and you’ll have many more opportunities in the future.
Good luck to you on your math competitions. W e hope you found this
