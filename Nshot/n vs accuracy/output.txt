Problem: The $n^{\text{th}}$ term of a certain geometric series is given by $a\cdot r^{n-1}$, where $a$ and $r$ are positive integers and $r$ is greater than 1. Bill picks out $k$ different numbers in this sequence, all of which have the same number of digits. What is the largest possible value of $k$?
Model Response: To find the largest possible value of \( k \) such that Bill can pick \( k \) different numbers from the geometric series \( a \cdot r^{n-1} \) with the same number of digits, we need to analyze the number of digits in the terms of the series.

The number of digits \( d \) of a number \( x \) can be determined using the formula:
\[
d = \lfloor \log_{10} x \rfloor + 1
\]
For the \( n^{\text{th}} \) term of the geometric series, we have:
\[
x_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}
\]
Thus, the number of digits in \( x_n \) is:
\[
d_n = \lfloor \log_{10} (a \cdot r^{n-1}) \rfloor + 1 = \lfloor \log_{10} a + (n-1) \log_{10} r \rfloor + 1
\]

To have \( k \) different terms with the same number of digits, we need:
\[
\lfloor \log_{10} a + (n-1) \log_{10} r \rfloor = \lfloor \log_{10} a + (m-1) \log_{10} r \rfloor
\]
for \( n \) and \( m \) in the range of \( k \) different integers.

This means that the difference in the logarithmic values must be less than 1:
\[
\log_{10} a + (n-1) \log_{10} r < \log_{10} a + (m-1) \log_{10} r + 1
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
(n-1) \log_{10} r - (m-1) \log_{10} r < 1
\]
or
\[
(n-m) \log_{10} r < 1
\]
This implies:
\[
n - m < \frac{1}{\log_{10} r}
\]

The maximum integer value for \( n - m \) is given by:
\[
k - 1 < \frac{1}{\log_{10} r}
\]
Thus, we can express \( k \) as:
\[
k < \frac{1}{\log_{10} r} + 1
\]

Since \( r \) is a positive integer greater than 1, we can find the maximum \( k \) by considering the smallest possible value of \( \

Problem: If $a+b=7$ and $a^3+b^3=42$, what is the value of the sum $\dfrac{1}{a}+\dfrac{1}{b}$?  Express your answer as a common fraction.
Model Response: To solve for \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}\), we start with the given equations:

1. \(a + b = 7\)
2. \(a^3 + b^3 = 42\)

We can use the identity for the sum of cubes:

\[
a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)
\]

Substituting \(a + b = 7\) into the equation gives:

\[
42 = 7(a^2 - ab + b^2)
\]

Dividing both sides by 7:

\[
a^2 - ab + b^2 = 6
\]

Next, we can express \(a^2 + b^2\) in terms of \(a + b\) and \(ab\):

\[
a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab = 7^2 - 2ab = 49 - 2ab
\]

Now substituting this into our equation:

\[
49 - 2ab - ab = 6
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
49 - 3ab = 6
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
3ab = 49 - 6 = 43 \implies ab = \frac{43}{3}
\]

Now we can find \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}\):

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{a + b}{ab} = \frac{7}{\frac{43}{3}} = 7 \cdot \frac{3}{43} = \frac{21}{43}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{21}{43}}

Problem: Let $p(x)=\sqrt{-x}$, and $q(x)=8x^2+10x-3$. The domain of $p(q(x))$ can be written in the form $a\le x \le b$. Find $b-a$.
Model Response: To find the domain of \( p(q(x)) \), we first need to determine the conditions under which \( p(x) = \sqrt{-x} \) is defined. The function \( p(x) \) is defined when its argument is non-negative, i.e., \( -x \geq 0 \) or \( x \leq 0 \).

Next, we need to find the values of \( x \) for which \( q(x) = 8x^2 + 10x - 3 \) is less than or equal to zero:

\[
q(x) \leq 0 \implies 8x^2 + 10x - 3 \leq 0.
\]

To solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the equation \( 8x^2 + 10x - 3 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{10^2 - 4 \cdot 8 \cdot (-3)}}{2 \cdot 8}.
\]

Calculating the discriminant:

\[
b^2 - 4ac = 100 + 96 = 196.
\]

Now substituting back into the formula:

\[
x = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{196}}{16} = \frac{-10 \pm 14}{16}.
\]

This gives us two roots:

\[
x_1 = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4}, \quad x_2 = \frac{-24}{16} = -\frac{3}{2}.
\]

The roots are \( x = -\frac{3}{2} \) and \( x = \frac{1}{4} \). The quadratic opens upwards (since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive), so \( q(x) \leq 0 \) between the roots:

\[
-\frac{3}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Now, we need to find \( b - a \) where \( a = -\frac{3}{2} \) and \( b = \frac{1}{4} \):

\[
b - a = \frac{1}{4} - \left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{6

Problem: When the expression $-2x^2-20x-53$ is written in the form $a(x+d)^2+e$, where $a$, $d$, and $e$ are constants, what is the sum $a+d+e$?
Model Response: To rewrite the expression \(-2x^2 - 20x - 53\) in the form \(a(x+d)^2 + e\), we first factor out \(-2\) from the quadratic terms:

\[
-2(x^2 + 10x) - 53
\]

Next, we complete the square for the expression inside the parentheses. To do this, we take half of the coefficient of \(x\) (which is \(10\)), square it, and add and subtract that square inside the parentheses:

\[
-2\left(x^2 + 10x + 25 - 25\right) - 53
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-2\left((x + 5)^2 - 25\right) - 53
\]

Distributing the \(-2\):

\[
-2(x + 5)^2 + 50 - 53
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-2(x + 5)^2 - 3
\]

Now we can identify the constants \(a\), \(d\), and \(e\):

- \(a = -2\)
- \(d = 5\)
- \(e = -3\)

Now we calculate the sum \(a + d + e\):

\[
a + d + e = -2 + 5 - 3 = 0
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[

Problem: Sue can either borrow $10,\!000$ dollars for $5$ years with a simple interest of $7\%$ annually or an interest which compounds annually for $6\%$. How much more money, rounded to the nearest dollar, would she have to pay back for the more expensive interest than the less expensive interest?
Model Response: To find out how much more money Sue would have to pay back for the more expensive interest compared to the less expensive interest, we will calculate the total amount to be paid back for both the simple interest and the compound interest.

1. **Simple Interest Calculation:**
   The formula for simple interest is given by:
   \[
   A = P(1 + rt)
   \]
   where:
   - \( P = 10,000 \) (the principal),
   - \( r = 0.07 \) (the interest rate),
   - \( t = 5 \) (the time in years).

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   A = 10,000(1 + 0.07 \times 5) = 10,000(1 + 0.35) = 10,000 \times 1.35 = 13,500
   \]

2. **Compound Interest Calculation:**
   The formula for compound interest is given by:
   \[
   A = P(1 + r)^t
   \]
   where:
   - \( P = 10,000 \) (the principal),
   - \( r = 0.06 \) (the interest rate),
   - \( t = 5 \) (the time in years).

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   A = 10,000(1 + 0.06)^5 = 10,000(1.06)^5
   \]
   First, we calculate \( (1.06)^5 \):
   \[
   (1.06)^5 \approx 1.338225
   \]
   Now, substituting this back into the formula:
   \[
   A \approx 10,000 \times 1.338225 \approx 13,382.25
   \]

3. **Calculating the Difference:**
   Now we find the difference between the amounts to be paid back:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 13,500 - 13,382.25 \approx 117.75
   \]

   Rounding to the nearest dollar gives us:
   \[
   \text{Difference} \approx 118
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{118}

Problem: Suppose $x$ is a solution to $x^2 + 1 = 7x$. What is the sum of $x$ and its reciprocal?
Model Response: To solve the equation \( x^2 + 1 = 7x \), we first rearrange it into standard form:

\[
x^2 - 7x + 1 = 0
\]

Next, we can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), and \( c = 1 \). Plugging in these values, we have:

\[
x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 - 4}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{45}}{2}
\]

Since \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \), we can simplify this to:

\[
x = \frac{7 \pm 3\sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

Now, we need to find the sum of \( x \) and its reciprocal \( \frac{1}{x} \). The sum can be expressed as:

\[
x + \frac{1}{x} = x + \frac{2}{7 \pm 3\sqrt{5}}
\]

To simplify \( \frac{1}{x} \), we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate:

\[
\frac{1}{x} = \frac{2(7 \mp 3\sqrt{5})}{(7 \pm 3\sqrt{5})(7 \mp 3\sqrt{5})} = \frac{2(7 \mp 3\sqrt{5})}{49 - 45} = \frac{2(7 \mp 3\sqrt{5})}{4} = \frac{7 \mp 3\sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

Now, we can add \( x \) and \( \frac{1}{x} \):

\[
x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7 \pm 3\sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{7 \mp 3\sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{(7 + 7) + (3\sqrt{5} - 3\sqrt{5})}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7
\]

Thus, the sum of \( x

Problem: If we express $3x^2 + x - 4$ in the form $a(x - h)^2 + k$, then what is $k$?
Model Response: To express the quadratic \(3x^2 + x - 4\) in the form \(a(x - h)^2 + k\), we will complete the square.

1. Start with the quadratic:
   \[
   3x^2 + x - 4
   \]

2. Factor out the coefficient of \(x^2\) from the first two terms:
   \[
   3\left(x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x\right) - 4
   \]

3. To complete the square inside the parentheses, take half of the coefficient of \(x\) (which is \(\frac{1}{3}\)), square it, and add and subtract it inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{36}
   \]
   So we rewrite it as:
   \[
   3\left(x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{36} - \frac{1}{36}\right) - 4
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   3\left(\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{36}\right) - 4
   \]

4. Distributing the 3 gives:
   \[
   3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{3}{36} - 4
   \]
   Simplifying \(-\frac{3}{36}\) gives \(-\frac{1}{12}\), so we have:
   \[
   3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{12} - 4
   \]

5. Convert \(-4\) to a fraction with a denominator of 12:
   \[
   -4 = -\frac{48}{12}
   \]
   Thus, we can combine the constants:
   \[
   -\frac{1}{12} - \frac{48}{12} = -\frac{49}{12}
   \]

6. Therefore, the expression becomes:
   \[
   3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{49}{12}
   \]

From this, we can identify \(k\) as:
\[
k = -\frac{49}{12}
\]

Finally, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{-\frac{49}{12}}
\]

Problem: A triangle is formed with edges along the line $y=\frac{2}{3}x+5$, the $x$-axis, and the line $x=k$. If the area of the triangle is less than $20$, find the sum of all possible integral values of $k$.
Model Response: To find the sum of all possible integral values of \( k \) such that the area of the triangle formed by the line \( y = \frac{2}{3}x + 5 \), the \( x \)-axis, and the line \( x = k \) is less than 20, we first need to determine the vertices of the triangle.

1. **Find the intersection of the line with the \( x \)-axis**:
   Set \( y = 0 \) in the equation of the line:
   \[
   0 = \frac{2}{3}x + 5 \implies \frac{2}{3}x = -5 \implies x = -\frac{15}{2} = -7.5.
   \]
   Thus, the intersection point is \( \left(-\frac{15}{2}, 0\right) \).

2. **Find the intersection of the line with \( x = k \)**:
   Substitute \( x = k \) into the line equation:
   \[
   y = \frac{2}{3}k + 5.
   \]
   The intersection point is \( (k, \frac{2}{3}k + 5) \).

3. **Calculate the area of the triangle**:
   The base of the triangle is the distance along the \( x \)-axis from \( x = -\frac{15}{2} \) to \( x = k \), which is:
   \[
   \text{Base} = k + \frac{15}{2} = k + 7.5.
   \]
   The height of the triangle is the \( y \)-coordinate of the point \( (k, \frac{2}{3}k + 5) \):
   \[
   \text{Height} = \frac{2}{3}k + 5.
   \]
   The area \( A \) of the triangle is given by:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height} = \frac{1}{2} \times (k + 7.5) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}k + 5\right).
   \]
   We want this area to be less than 20:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} (k + 7.5) \left(\frac{2}{3}k + 5\right) < 20.
   \]

Problem: Lana defines a function $f(x)$ which is given by the formula $$f(x) = x^2,$$ but only on a domain she has specified which consists of finitely many values $x$; she leaves the function undefined for all other $x$.

Given that the range of $f(x)$ is $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$, what is the maximum number of points that could be in its domain?
Model Response: To find the maximum number of points in the domain of the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) such that the range is \( \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\} \), we need to determine which values of \( x \) will yield outputs that fall within this range.

The function \( f(x) = x^2 \) produces non-negative outputs. We can find the values of \( x \) that correspond to each output in the range:

- For \( f(x) = 0 \): \( x = 0 \)
- For \( f(x) = 1 \): \( x = 1 \) or \( x = -1 \)
- For \( f(x) = 2 \): \( x = \sqrt{2} \) or \( x = -\sqrt{2} \)
- For \( f(x) = 3 \): \( x = \sqrt{3} \) or \( x = -\sqrt{3} \)
- For \( f(x) = 4 \): \( x = 2 \) or \( x = -2 \)
- For \( f(x) = 5 \): \( x = \sqrt{5} \) or \( x = -\sqrt{5} \)
- For \( f(x) = 6 \): \( x = \sqrt{6} \) or \( x = -\sqrt{6} \)
- For \( f(x) = 7 \): \( x = \sqrt{7} \) or \( x = -\sqrt{7} \)
- For \( f(x) = 8 \): \( x = \sqrt{8} \) or \( x = -\sqrt{8} \)
- For \( f(x) = 9 \): \( x = 3 \) or \( x = -3 \)

Now, we count the unique values of \( x \) that can be included in the domain:

- \( 0 \) contributes 1 point.
- \( 1 \) and \( -1 \) contribute 2 points.
- \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( -\sqrt{2} \) contribute 2 points.
- \( \sqrt{3} \) and \( -\sqrt{3} \) contribute 2 points.
- \( 2 \) and \( -2 \) contribute 2 points.
- \( \sqrt{5} \) and \( -\sqrt{5} \) contribute 2 points.
- \( \sqrt{6} \)

Problem: If $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive integers such that $6xyz+30xy+21xz+2yz+105x+10y+7z=812$, find $x+y+z$.
Model Response: To solve the equation \(6xyz + 30xy + 21xz + 2yz + 105x + 10y + 7z = 812\), we will first try to factor or simplify the expression.

We can rearrange the equation as follows:

\[
6xyz + 30xy + 21xz + 2yz + 105x + 10y + 7z - 812 = 0
\]

This is a polynomial in three variables \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). To find integer solutions, we can try small positive integer values for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).

Let's start by testing small values for \(x\):

1. **Let \(x = 1\)**:
   \[
   6(1)yz + 30(1)y + 21(1)z + 2yz + 105(1) + 10y + 7z = 812
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   6yz + 30y + 21z + 2yz + 105 + 10y + 7z = 812
   \]
   \[
   (6 + 2)yz + (30 + 10)y + (21 + 7)z + 105 = 812
   \]
   \[
   8yz + 40y + 28z + 105 = 812
   \]
   \[
   8yz + 40y + 28z = 707
   \]

   Now, we can try small values for \(y\) and \(z\).

   - **Let \(y = 1\)**:
     \[
     8(1)z + 40(1) + 28z = 707
     \]
     \[
     8z + 40 + 28z = 707

     \[
     36z + 40 = 707
     \]
     \[
     36z = 667 \implies z = \frac{667}{36} \text{ (not an integer)}
     \]

   - **Let \(y = 2\)**:
     \[
     8(2)z + 40(2) + 28z = 707
     \]
     \[
     16z + 80 + 28z = 707

Problem: The polynomial $p(x) = x^2+ax+b$ has distinct roots $2a$ and $b$. Find $a+b$.
Model Response: To find \( a + b \) given that the polynomial \( p(x) = x^2 + ax + b \) has distinct roots \( 2a \) and \( b \), we can use Vieta's formulas. According to Vieta's, for a quadratic polynomial \( x^2 + px + q \) with roots \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \):

1. The sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 = -p \).
2. The product of the roots \( r_1 r_2 = q \).

In our case, the roots are \( 2a \) and \( b \). Therefore, we have:

1. \( 2a + b = -a \)
2. \( 2a \cdot b = b \)

From the second equation, if \( b \neq 0 \), we can divide both sides by \( b \):

\[
2a = 1 \implies a = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Substituting \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) into the first equation:

\[
2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + b = -\frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
1 + b = -\frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
b = -\frac{1}{2} - 1 = -\frac{3}{2}
\]

Now we can find \( a + b \):

\[
a + b = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{3}{2} = -1

Problem: A ball is dropped straight down from a height of 16 feet. If it bounces back each time to a height one-half the height from which it last fell, how far will the ball have traveled when it hits the floor for the sixth time, in feet?
Model Response: To find the total distance traveled by the ball when it hits the floor for the sixth time, we can analyze the sequence of bounces.

1. The ball is dropped from a height of 16 feet. It falls 16 feet to the ground.
2. After hitting the ground, it bounces back to a height of \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) feet.
3. It then falls 8 feet back to the ground.
4. Next, it bounces back to a height of \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) feet.
5. It falls 4 feet back to the ground.
6. Then, it bounces back to a height of \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) feet.
7. It falls 2 feet back to the ground.
8. Finally, it bounces back to a height of \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) foot.
9. It falls 1 foot back to the ground.

Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled:

- First drop: 16 feet
- First bounce up: 8 feet
- Second drop: 8 feet
- Second bounce up: 4 feet
- Third drop: 4 feet
- Third bounce up: 2 feet
- Fourth drop: 2 feet
- Fourth bounce up: 1 foot
- Fifth drop: 1 foot

Now, we sum these distances:

\[
\text{Total distance} = 16 + 8 + 8 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

\[
16 + 8 = 24
\]
\[
24 + 8 = 32
\]
\[
32 + 4 = 36
\]

Problem: The quadratic $3x^2-24x+72$ can be written in the form $a(x+b)^2+c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. What is $a+b+c$?
Model Response: To rewrite the quadratic \(3x^2 - 24x + 72\) in the form \(a(x+b)^2+c\), we first factor out the coefficient of \(x^2\) from the first two terms:

\[
3(x^2 - 8x) + 72
\]

Next, we complete the square for the expression inside the parentheses. To do this, we take half of the coefficient of \(x\) (which is \(-8\)), square it, and add and subtract that value inside the parentheses:

\[
3\left(x^2 - 8x + 16 - 16\right) + 72
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3\left((x - 4)^2 - 16\right) + 72
\]

Distributing the \(3\):

\[
3(x - 4)^2 - 48 + 72
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3(x - 4)^2 + 24
\]

Now we can identify the constants \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

- \(a = 3\)
- \(b = -4\)
- \(c = 24\)

Now we calculate \(a + b + c\):

\[
a + b + c = 3 - 4 + 24 = 23
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

Problem: Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are nonzero real numbers, and that the equation  $${x^2 + ax + b = 0}$$ has solutions $a$ and $b$. Then what is the pair $(a,b)$?
Model Response: To solve the problem, we start with the quadratic equation given:

\[
x^2 + ax + b = 0
\]

We know that the solutions to this equation are \(a\) and \(b\). By Vieta's formulas, we have:

1. The sum of the roots \(a + b = -a\)
2. The product of the roots \(ab = b\)

From the first equation, we can rearrange it:

\[
a + b + a = 0 \implies 2a + b = 0 \implies b = -2a
\]

Now substituting \(b = -2a\) into the second equation:

\[
a(-2a) = -2a
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-2a^2 = -2a
\]

Assuming \(a \neq 0\) (since \(a\) and \(b\) are nonzero), we can divide both sides by \(-2\):

\[
a^2 = a
\]

This gives us:

\[
a(a - 1) = 0
\]

Thus, \(a = 1\) (since \(a\) cannot be zero). Now substituting \(a = 1\) back into the equation for \(b\):

\[
b = -2(1) = -2
\]

So the pair \((a, b)\) is:

\[
(1, -2)
\]

Finally, we present the answer in the required format:

\[
\boxed{(1, -2)}

Problem: The $n^{\text{th}}$ term of a certain geometric series is given by $a\cdot r^{n-1}$, where $a$ and $r$ are positive integers and $r$ is greater than 1. Bill picks out $k$ different numbers in this sequence, all of which have the same number of digits. What is the largest possible value of $k$?
Model Response: To find the largest possible value of \( k \) such that Bill can pick \( k \) different numbers from the geometric series \( a \cdot r^{n-1} \) with the same number of digits, we need to analyze the number of digits in the terms of the series.

The number of digits \( d \) of a number \( x \) can be determined using the formula:
\[
d = \lfloor \log_{10} x \rfloor + 1
\]
For the \( n^{\text{th}} \) term of the geometric series, we have:
\[
x_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}
\]
Thus, the number of digits in \( x_n \) is:
\[
d_n = \lfloor \log_{10} (a \cdot r^{n-1}) \rfloor + 1 = \lfloor \log_{10} a + (n-1) \log_{10} r \rfloor + 1
\]

To have \( k \) different terms with the same number of digits, we need:
\[
\lfloor \log_{10} a + (n-1) \log_{10} r \rfloor = \lfloor \log_{10} a + (m-1) \log_{10} r \rfloor
\]
for \( n \) and \( m \) in the range of \( k \) different integers.

This means that the fractional part of \( \log_{10} a + (n-1) \log_{10} r \) must remain within the same integer range for \( k \) consecutive values of \( n \). The difference between the \( n^{\text{th}} \) and \( (n+k-1)^{\text{th}} \) terms is:
\[
(n+k-1) \log_{10} r - (n-1) \log_{10} r = k \log_{10} r
\]
This difference must be less than 1 to ensure that the floor function does not change:
\[
k \log_{10} r < 1 \implies k < \frac{1}{\log_{10} r}
\]

Since \( r \) is a positive integer greater than 1, we can find the maximum \( k \) by minimizing \( \log_{10} r \). The smallest integer \( r \) can be is 2, thus:
\[
\log_{10} 2 \approx 0.301
\]
Calculating \( k \):
\[
k < \frac{1}{0.301} \approx 3.32
\]
Since \( k \) must be an integer, the maximum value of \( k \) is 3.

Problem: If $a+b=7$ and $a^3+b^3=42$, what is the value of the sum $\dfrac{1}{a}+\dfrac{1}{b}$?  Express your answer as a common fraction.
Model Response: To find the value of \(\dfrac{1}{a}+\dfrac{1}{b}\), we can start by using the identity for the sum of cubes:

\[
a^3 + b^3 = (a+b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)
\]

Given that \(a + b = 7\) and \(a^3 + b^3 = 42\), we can substitute \(a + b\) into the equation:

\[
42 = 7(a^2 - ab + b^2)
\]

Dividing both sides by 7 gives:

\[
a^2 - ab + b^2 = 6
\]

Next, we can express \(a^2 + b^2\) in terms of \(a + b\) and \(ab\):

\[
a^2 + b^2 = (a+b)^2 - 2ab = 7^2 - 2ab = 49 - 2ab
\]

Substituting this into our earlier equation:

\[
49 - 2ab - ab = 6
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
49 - 3ab = 6
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
3ab = 49 - 6 = 43 \implies ab = \frac{43}{3}
\]

Now, we can find \(\dfrac{1}{a} + \dfrac{1}{b}\):

\[
\dfrac{1}{a} + \dfrac{1}{b} = \dfrac{a+b}{ab} = \dfrac{7}{\frac{43}{3}} = 7 \cdot \frac{3}{43} = \frac{21}{43}

Thus, the final answer is:

Problem: Let $p(x)=\sqrt{-x}$, and $q(x)=8x^2+10x-3$. The domain of $p(q(x))$ can be written in the form $a\le x \le b$. Find $b-a$.
Model Response: To find the domain of \( p(q(x)) \), we first need to determine the conditions under which \( p(x) = \sqrt{-x} \) is defined. The function \( p(x) \) is defined when its argument is non-negative, i.e., 

\[
-q(x) \geq 0 \implies q(x) \leq 0.
\]

Next, we need to analyze the quadratic function \( q(x) = 8x^2 + 10x - 3 \). To find the values of \( x \) for which \( q(x) \leq 0 \), we first find the roots of the equation \( q(x) = 0 \) using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{10^2 - 4 \cdot 8 \cdot (-3)}}{2 \cdot 8}.
\]

Calculating the discriminant:

\[
b^2 - 4ac = 100 + 96 = 196.
\]

Now substituting back into the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{196}}{16} = \frac{-10 \pm 14}{16}.
\]

This gives us two roots:

1. \( x_1 = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4} \)
2. \( x_2 = \frac{-24}{16} = -\frac{3}{2} \)

The roots of the quadratic \( q(x) \) are \( x = -\frac{3}{2} \) and \( x = \frac{1}{4} \). Since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) in \( q(x) \) is positive (8), the parabola opens upwards. Therefore, \( q(x) \leq 0 \) between the roots:

\[
-\frac{3}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Now, we can find \( b - a \):

\[
b - a = \frac{1}{4} - \left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{6}{4} = \frac{7}{4}.

Problem: When the expression $-2x^2-20x-53$ is written in the form $a(x+d)^2+e$, where $a$, $d$, and $e$ are constants, what is the sum $a+d+e$?
Model Response: To rewrite the expression \(-2x^2 - 20x - 53\) in the form \(a(x+d)^2 + e\), we will complete the square.

1. Start with the expression:
   \[
   -2x^2 - 20x - 53
   \]

2. Factor out \(-2\) from the quadratic and linear terms:
   \[
   -2(x^2 + 10x) - 53
   \]

3. To complete the square for \(x^2 + 10x\), take half of the coefficient of \(x\) (which is \(10\)), square it, and add and subtract it inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \text{Half of } 10 = 5, \quad 5^2 = 25
   \]
   Thus, we rewrite:
   \[
   -2(x^2 + 10x + 25 - 25) - 53
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   -2((x + 5)^2 - 25) - 53
   \]

4. Distributing \(-2\):
   \[
   -2(x + 5)^2 + 50 - 53
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   -2(x + 5)^2 - 3
   \]

Now we have the expression in the form \(a(x+d)^2 + e\):
- \(a = -2\)
- \(d = 5\)
- \(e = -3\)

5. Now, we find the sum \(a + d + e\):

   a + d + e = -2 + 5 - 3 = 0

Problem: Sue can either borrow $10,\!000$ dollars for $5$ years with a simple interest of $7\%$ annually or an interest which compounds annually for $6\%$. How much more money, rounded to the nearest dollar, would she have to pay back for the more expensive interest than the less expensive interest?
Model Response: To find out how much more money Sue would have to pay back for the more expensive interest compared to the less expensive interest, we will calculate the total amount to be paid back for both options.

1. **Simple Interest Calculation (7% for 5 years)**:
   The formula for simple interest is:
   \[
   A = P(1 + rt)
   \]
   where:
   - \( P = 10,000 \) (the principal)
   - \( r = 0.07 \) (the interest rate)
   - \( t = 5 \) (the time in years)

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   A = 10,000(1 + 0.07 \times 5) = 10,000(1 + 0.35) = 10,000 \times 1.35 = 13,500
   \]

2. **Compound Interest Calculation (6% compounded annually for 5 years)**:
   The formula for compound interest is:
   \[
   A = P(1 + r)^t
   \]
   where:
   - \( P = 10,000 \)
   - \( r = 0.06 \)
   - \( t = 5 \)

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   A = 10,000(1 + 0.06)^5 = 10,000(1.06)^5
   \]
   First, we calculate \( (1.06)^5 \):
   \[
   (1.06)^5 \approx 1.338225
   \]
   Now, substituting back:
   \[
   A \approx 10,000 \times 1.338225 \approx 13,382.25
   \]

3. **Calculating the difference**:
   Now we find the difference between the amounts to be paid back:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 13,500 - 13,382.25 \approx 117.75
   \]
   Rounding to the nearest dollar gives us:
   \[
   \text{Difference} \approx 118

Problem: Suppose $x$ is a solution to $x^2 + 1 = 7x$. What is the sum of $x$ and its reciprocal?
Model Response: To solve the equation \( x^2 + 1 = 7x \), we first rearrange it into standard form:

\[
x^2 - 7x + 1 = 0
\]

Next, we can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), and \( c = 1 \). Plugging in these values, we have:

\[
x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 - 4}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{45}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{7 \pm 3\sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

Now, we have two possible values for \( x \):

\[
x_1 = \frac{7 + 3\sqrt{5}}{2}, \quad x_2 = \frac{7 - 3\sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

Next, we need to find the sum of \( x \) and its reciprocal \( \frac{1}{x} \). The sum can be expressed as:

\[
x + \frac{1}{x} = x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{x^2 + 1}{x}
\]

Using the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 7x + 1 = 0 \), we know that \( x^2 = 7x - 1 \). Therefore, we can substitute \( x^2 \) into our expression:

\[
x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{(7x - 1) + 1}{x} = \frac{7x}{x} = 7
\]

Thus, the sum of \( x \) and its reciprocal is:

Model Response: To express the quadratic \(3x^2 + x - 4\) in the form \(a(x - h)^2 + k\), we will complete the square.

1. Start with the quadratic:
   \[
   3x^2 + x - 4
   \]

2. Factor out the coefficient of \(x^2\) (which is 3) from the first two terms:
   \[
   3\left(x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x\right) - 4
   \]

3. To complete the square inside the parentheses, take half of the coefficient of \(x\) (which is \(\frac{1}{3}\)), square it, and add and subtract it inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{36}
   \]
   So we rewrite it as:
   \[
   3\left(x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{36} - \frac{1}{36}\right) - 4
   \]

4. This simplifies to:
   \[
   3\left(\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{36}\right) - 4
   \]

5. Distributing the 3 gives:
   \[
   3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{3}{36} - 4
   \]
   \[
   = 3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{12} - 4
   \]

6. Convert \(-4\) to a fraction with a denominator of 12:
   \[
   -4 = -\frac{48}{12}
   \]

7. Combine the constants:
   \[
   -\frac{1}{12} - \frac{48}{12} = -\frac{49}{12}
   \]

8. Thus, we have:
   \[
   3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{49}{12}
   \]

From this, we can identify \(k\) as:
\[
k = -\frac{49}{12}

Finally, the answer is:

Problem: A triangle is formed with edges along the line $y=\frac{2}{3}x+5$, the $x$-axis, and the line $x=k$. If the area of the triangle is less than $20$, find the sum of all possible integral values of $k$.
Model Response: To find the sum of all possible integral values of \( k \) such that the area of the triangle formed by the line \( y = \frac{2}{3}x + 5 \), the \( x \)-axis, and the line \( x = k \) is less than 20, we start by determining the vertices of the triangle.

1. **Find the intersection of the line with the \( x \)-axis**:
   Set \( y = 0 \) in the equation of the line:
   \[
   0 = \frac{2}{3}x + 5 \implies \frac{2}{3}x = -5 \implies x = -\frac{15}{2} = -7.5.
   \]
   Thus, the intersection point is \( \left(-\frac{15}{2}, 0\right) \).

2. **Find the intersection of the line with \( x = k \)**:
   Substitute \( x = k \) into the line equation:
   \[
   y = \frac{2}{3}k + 5.
   \]
   The intersection point is \( (k, \frac{2}{3}k + 5) \).

3. **Calculate the area of the triangle**:
   The base of the triangle is the horizontal distance from \( x = -\frac{15}{2} \) to \( x = k \), which is:
   \[
   \text{Base} = k + \frac{15}{2} = k + 7.5.
   \]
   The height of the triangle is the \( y \)-coordinate of the point \( (k, \frac{2}{3}k + 5) \):
   \[
   \text{Height} = \frac{2}{3}k + 5.
   \]
   The area \( A \) of the triangle is given by:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height} = \frac{1}{2} \times (k + 7.5) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}k + 5\right).
   \]
   We want this area to be less than 20:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times (k + 7.5) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}k + 5\right) < 20.
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 2:
   \[
   (k + 7.5) \left(\frac{2}{3}k + 5\right) < 40.

Given that the range of $f(x)$ is $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$, what is the maximum number of points that could be in its domain?
Model Response: To determine the maximum number of points in the domain of the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) such that the range is limited to \( \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\} \), we need to find the values of \( x \) for which \( x^2 \) produces results within this range.

The values of \( x^2 \) that yield the range \( \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\} \) correspond to the following values of \( x \):

- \( x^2 = 0 \) gives \( x = 0 \)
- \( x^2 = 1 \) gives \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -1 \)
- \( x^2 = 2 \) gives \( x = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \)

- \( x^2 = 4 \) gives \( x = 2 \) and \( x = -2 \)

- \( x^2 = 6 \) gives \( x = \sqrt{6} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{6} \)
- \( x^2 = 7 \) gives \( x = \sqrt{7} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{7} \)
- \( x^2 = 8 \) gives \( x = \sqrt{8} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{8} \)
- \( x^2 = 9 \) gives \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -3 \)

Model Response: To solve the equation \( 6xyz + 30xy + 21xz + 2yz + 105x + 10y + 7z = 812 \), we will first rearrange and factor the left-hand side.

We can rewrite the equation as follows:

\[
6xyz + 30xy + 21xz + 2yz + 105x + 10y + 7z - 812 = 0
\]

Next, we will try to find integer solutions for \( x, y, z \). We can start by testing small positive integer values for \( x, y, z \).

Let's try \( x = 1 \):

\[
6(1)yz + 30(1)y + 21(1)z + 2yz + 105(1) + 10y + 7z = 812

\[
(6yz + 2yz) + (30y + 10y) + (21z + 7z) + 105 = 812

\[
8yz + 40y + 28z + 105 = 812

Problem: The polynomial $p(x) = x^2+ax+b$ has distinct roots $2a$ and $b$. Find $a+b$.
Model Response: To find \( a + b \) for the polynomial \( p(x) = x^2 + ax + b \) with distinct roots \( 2a \) and \( b \), we can use Vieta's formulas. According to Vieta's, for a quadratic polynomial \( x^2 + px + q \) with roots \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \):

1. The sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 = -p \).
2. The product of the roots \( r_1 r_2 = q \).

In our case, the roots are \( 2a \) and \( b \). Therefore, we have:

1. \( 2a + b = -a \)
2. \( 2a \cdot b = b \)

From the first equation, we can rearrange it:

\[
2a + b + a = 0 \implies 3a + b = 0 \implies b = -3a
\]

Now substituting \( b = -3a \) into the second equation:

\[
2a \cdot (-3a) = -3a
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-6a^2 = -3a
\]

Assuming \( a \neq 0 \) (since the roots are distinct), we can divide both sides by \( -3a \):

\[
2a = 1 \implies a = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Now substituting \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) back into the equation for \( b \):

\[
b = -3a = -3 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = -\frac{3}{2}
\]

Now we can find \( a + b \):

\[
a + b = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{3}{2} = -1
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{-1}

Problem: A ball is dropped straight down from a height of 16 feet. If it bounces back each time to a height one-half the height from which it last fell, how far will the ball have traveled when it hits the floor for the sixth time, in feet?
Model Response: To find the total distance traveled by the ball when it hits the floor for the sixth time, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. The ball is dropped from a height of 16 feet. This is the first fall.
2. After hitting the ground, it bounces back to a height of \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) feet.
3. It then falls again from 8 feet.
4. After hitting the ground the second time, it bounces back to a height of \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) feet.
5. It falls again from 4 feet.
6. After hitting the ground the third time, it bounces back to a height of \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) feet.
7. It falls again from 2 feet.
8. After hitting the ground the fourth time, it bounces back to a height of \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) foot.
9. It falls again from 1 foot.
10. After hitting the ground the fifth time, it bounces back to a height of \( \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \) feet.
11. It falls again from 0.5 feet.

Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled:

- First fall: 16 feet
- First bounce up: 8 feet
- Second fall: 8 feet
- Second bounce up: 4 feet
- Third fall: 4 feet
- Third bounce up: 2 feet
- Fourth fall: 2 feet
- Fourth bounce up: 1 foot
- Fifth fall: 1 foot
- Fifth bounce up: 0.5 feet
- Sixth fall: 0.5 feet

Now, we can sum these distances:

\[
\text{Total distance} = 16 + 8 + 8 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.5
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

\[
16 + 8 = 24
\]
\[
24 + 8 = 32
\]
\[
32 + 4 = 36
\]
\[
36 + 4 = 40
\]
\[
40 + 2 = 42
\]
\[
42 + 2 = 44
\]
\[
44 + 1 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 1 = 46
\]
\[
46 + 0.5 = 46.5
\]
\[
46.5 + 0.5 = 47
\]

Thus, the total distance traveled by the ball when it hits the floor for the sixth time is \( 47 \) feet.

Problem: The quadratic $3x^2-24x+72$ can be written in the form $a(x+b)^2+c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. What is $a+b+c$?
Model Response: To rewrite the quadratic \(3x^2 - 24x + 72\) in the form \(a(x+b)^2+c\), we will complete the square.

1. Start with the quadratic:
   \[
   3x^2 - 24x + 72
   \]

2. Factor out the coefficient of \(x^2\) (which is 3) from the first two terms:
   \[
   3(x^2 - 8x) + 72
   \]

3. To complete the square for the expression \(x^2 - 8x\), take half of the coefficient of \(x\) (which is -8), square it, and add and subtract it inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \text{Half of } -8 = -4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (-4)^2 = 16
   \]
   Thus, we rewrite:
   \[
   3(x^2 - 8x + 16 - 16) + 72
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   3((x - 4)^2 - 16) + 72
   \]

4. Distributing the 3 gives:
   \[
   3(x - 4)^2 - 48 + 72
   \]
   Simplifying further:
   \[
   3(x - 4)^2 + 24
   \]

Now we have the quadratic in the form \(a(x+b)^2+c\):
- \(a = 3\)
- \(b = -4\)
- \(c = 24\)

Next, we calculate \(a + b + c\):
\[
a + b + c = 3 + (-4) + 24 = 3 - 4 + 24 = 23

Thus, the final answer is:

Problem: Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are nonzero real numbers, and that the equation  $${x^2 + ax + b = 0}$$ has solutions $a$ and $b$. Then what is the pair $(a,b)$?
Model Response: Given the quadratic equation \(x^2 + ax + b = 0\) with solutions \(a\) and \(b\), we can use Vieta's formulas, which state that for a quadratic equation \(x^2 + px + q = 0\), the sum of the roots is \(-p\) and the product of the roots is \(q\).

From the equation \(x^2 + ax + b = 0\), we have:
- The sum of the roots \(a + b = -a\)
- The product of the roots \(ab = b\)

From the first equation, we can rearrange it:
\[
a + b = -a \implies 2a + b = 0 \implies b = -2a
\]

Now substituting \(b = -2a\) into the second equation:
\[
ab = b \implies a(-2a) = -2a
\]
Assuming \(b \neq 0\) (since \(b\) is nonzero), we can divide both sides by \(-2a\):
\[
a = 1
\]

Now substituting \(a = 1\) back into the equation for \(b\):
\[
b = -2(1) = -2
\]

Thus, the pair \((a, b)\) is \((1, -2)\).

Problem: The $n^{\text{th}}$ term of a certain geometric series is given by $a\cdot r^{n-1}$, where $a$ and $r$ are positive integers and $r$ is greater than 1. Bill picks out $k$ different numbers in this sequence, all of which have the same number of digits. What is the largest possible value of $k$?
Model Response: To find the largest possible value of \( k \) such that Bill can pick \( k \) different numbers from the geometric series \( a \cdot r^{n-1} \) with the same number of digits, we need to analyze the number of digits in the terms of the series.

The number of digits \( d \) of a number \( x \) can be determined using the formula:
\[
d = \lfloor \log_{10} x \rfloor + 1
\]
For the \( n^{\text{th}} \) term of the geometric series, we have:
\[
x_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}
\]
Thus, the number of digits in \( x_n \) is:
\[
d_n = \lfloor \log_{10} (a \cdot r^{n-1}) \rfloor + 1 = \lfloor \log_{10} a + (n-1) \log_{10} r \rfloor + 1
\]

To have \( k \) different terms with the same number of digits, we need:
\[
\lfloor \log_{10} a + (n-1) \log_{10} r \rfloor = \lfloor \log_{10} a + (m-1) \log_{10} r \rfloor
\]
for \( n \) and \( m \) in the range of \( k \) different integers.

This means that the fractional part of \( \log_{10} a + (n-1) \log_{10} r \) must remain within the same integer range for \( k \) consecutive values of \( n \). The difference between the \( n^{\text{th}} \) and \( (n+k-1)^{\text{th}} \) terms must not exceed 1 in the logarithmic scale:
\[
(n+k-1) \log_{10} r - n \log_{10} r < 1
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(k-1) \log_{10} r < 1 \implies k < \frac{1}{\log_{10} r}
\]

Since \( r \) is a positive integer greater than 1, we can find the maximum \( k \) by minimizing \( \log_{10} r \). The smallest integer \( r \) can be is 2, thus:
\[
\log_{10} 2 \approx 0.301
\]
Therefore:
\[
k < \frac{1}{0.301} \approx 3.32
\]
Since \( k \) must be an integer, the maximum value of \( k \) is 3.

Thus, the largest possible value of \( k \) is:
\[
\boxed{3}

Problem: If $a+b=7$ and $a^3+b^3=42$, what is the value of the sum $\dfrac{1}{a}+\dfrac{1}{b}$?  Express your answer as a common fraction.
Model Response: To find the value of \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}\), we can use the identity:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{a+b}{ab}
\]

Given that \(a + b = 7\), we need to find \(ab\). We can use the identity for the sum of cubes:

\[
a^3 + b^3 = (a+b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)
\]

We can express \(a^2 + b^2\) in terms of \(a + b\) and \(ab\):

\[
a^2 + b^2 = (a+b)^2 - 2ab = 7^2 - 2ab = 49 - 2ab
\]

Substituting this into the sum of cubes formula gives:

\[
a^3 + b^3 = (a+b)((a^2 + b^2) - ab) = (a+b)(49 - 3ab)
\]

Substituting \(a + b = 7\) and \(a^3 + b^3 = 42\):

\[
42 = 7(49 - 3ab)
\]

Dividing both sides by 7:

\[
6 = 49 - 3ab
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
3ab = 49 - 6 = 43 \implies ab = \frac{43}{3}
\]

Now we can substitute \(a + b\) and \(ab\) back into the expression for \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}\):

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{a+b}{ab} = \frac{7}{\frac{43}{3}} = 7 \cdot \frac{3}{43} = \frac{21}{43}

Thus, the final answer is:

Problem: Let $p(x)=\sqrt{-x}$, and $q(x)=8x^2+10x-3$. The domain of $p(q(x))$ can be written in the form $a\le x \le b$. Find $b-a$.
Model Response: To find the domain of \( p(q(x)) \), we first need to determine the conditions under which \( p(x) = \sqrt{-x} \) is defined. The function \( p(x) \) is defined when its argument is non-negative, i.e., 

\[
-q(x) \geq 0 \implies q(x) \leq 0.
\]

Next, we need to analyze the quadratic function \( q(x) = 8x^2 + 10x - 3 \). To find the values of \( x \) for which \( q(x) \leq 0 \), we first find the roots of the equation \( q(x) = 0 \) using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{10^2 - 4 \cdot 8 \cdot (-3)}}{2 \cdot 8}.
\]

Calculating the discriminant:

\[
b^2 - 4ac = 100 + 96 = 196.
\]

Now substituting back into the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{196}}{16} = \frac{-10 \pm 14}{16}.
\]

This gives us two roots:

\[
x_1 = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4}, \quad x_2 = \frac{-24}{16} = -\frac{3}{2}.
\]

The roots of the quadratic \( q(x) \) are \( x = -\frac{3}{2} \) and \( x = \frac{1}{4} \). Since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive (8), the parabola opens upwards. Therefore, \( q(x) \leq 0 \) between the roots:

\[
-\frac{3}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Now, we can express the domain of \( p(q(x)) \) as:

\[
a = -\frac{3}{2}, \quad b = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

To find \( b - a \):

\[
b - a = \frac{1}{4} - \left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{6}{4} = \frac{7}{4}.
\]

\[
\boxed{\frac{7}{4}}.

Model Response: To rewrite the expression \(-2x^2 - 20x - 53\) in the form \(a(x+d)^2 + e\), we first factor out \(-2\) from the quadratic terms:

\[
-2(x^2 + 10x) - 53
\]

Next, we complete the square for the expression inside the parentheses. To do this, we take half of the coefficient of \(x\) (which is \(10\)), square it, and add and subtract that square inside the parentheses:

\[
-2\left(x^2 + 10x + 25 - 25\right) - 53
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-2\left((x + 5)^2 - 25\right) - 53
\]

Distributing the \(-2\):

\[
-2(x + 5)^2 + 50 - 53
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-2(x + 5)^2 - 3

Now we can identify the constants \(a\), \(d\), and \(e\):

- \(a = -2\)
- \(d = 5\)
- \(e = -3\)

\[
a + d + e = -2 + 5 - 3 = 0

Problem: Sue can either borrow $10,\!000$ dollars for $5$ years with a simple interest of $7\%$ annually or an interest which compounds annually for $6\%$. How much more money, rounded to the nearest dollar, would she have to pay back for the more expensive interest than the less expensive interest?
Model Response: To find out how much more money Sue would have to pay back for the more expensive interest compared to the less expensive interest, we will calculate the total amount to be paid back for both options.

1. **Simple Interest Calculation (7% for 5 years)**:
   The formula for simple interest is:
   \[
   A = P(1 + rt)
   \]
   where:
   - \( P = 10,000 \) (the principal),
   - \( r = 0.07 \) (the annual interest rate),
   - \( t = 5 \) (the time in years).

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   A = 10,000(1 + 0.07 \times 5) = 10,000(1 + 0.35) = 10,000 \times 1.35 = 13,500
   \]

2. **Compound Interest Calculation (6% compounded annually for 5 years)**:
   The formula for compound interest is:
   \[
   A = P(1 + r)^t
   \]
   where:
   - \( P = 10,000 \),
   - \( r = 0.06 \),
   - \( t = 5 \).

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   A = 10,000(1 + 0.06)^5 = 10,000(1.06)^5
   \]
   Now we calculate \( (1.06)^5 \):
   \[
   (1.06)^5 \approx 1.338225
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   A \approx 10,000 \times 1.338225 \approx 13,382.25
   \]

3. **Calculating the difference**:
   Now we find the difference between the amounts to be paid back:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 13,500 - 13,382.25 \approx 117.75
   \]
   Rounding to the nearest dollar gives us:
   \[
   \text{Difference} \approx 118

Problem: Suppose $x$ is a solution to $x^2 + 1 = 7x$. What is the sum of $x$ and its reciprocal?
Model Response: To solve the equation \( x^2 + 1 = 7x \), we first rearrange it into standard form:

\[
x^2 - 7x + 1 = 0.
\]

Next, we can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},
\]

where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), and \( c = 1 \). Plugging in these values, we have:

\[
x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 - 4}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{45}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm 3\sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Thus, the two solutions for \( x \) are:

\[
x_1 = \frac{7 + 3\sqrt{5}}{2}, \quad x_2 = \frac{7 - 3\sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Next, we need to find the sum of \( x \) and its reciprocal \( \frac{1}{x} \). The sum can be expressed as:

\[
x + \frac{1}{x} = x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{x^2 + 1}{x}.
\]

Using the quadratic equation we derived earlier, we know \( x^2 = 7x - 1 \). Therefore, we can substitute \( x^2 \) into the expression:

\[
x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{(7x - 1) + 1}{x} = \frac{7x}{x} = 7.
\]

Thus, the sum of \( x \) and its reciprocal is:

\[

Model Response: To express the quadratic \(3x^2 + x - 4\) in the form \(a(x - h)^2 + k\), we will complete the square.

1. Start with the quadratic:
   \[
   3x^2 + x - 4
   \]

2. Factor out the coefficient of \(x^2\) from the first two terms:
   \[
   3\left(x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x\right) - 4
   \]

3. To complete the square inside the parentheses, take half of the coefficient of \(x\) (which is \(\frac{1}{3}\)), square it, and add and subtract it inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \text{Half of } \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6}, \quad \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{36}
   \]
   So we rewrite it as:
   \[
   3\left(x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{36} - \frac{1}{36}\right) - 4
   \]

4. This simplifies to:
   \[
   3\left(\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{36}\right) - 4
   \]

5. Distributing the \(3\):
   \[
   3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{3}{36} - 4 = 3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{12} - 4
   \]

6. Convert \(-4\) to a fraction with a denominator of \(12\):
   \[
   -4 = -\frac{48}{12}
   \]

7. Combine the constants:
   \[
   -\frac{1}{12} - \frac{48}{12} = -\frac{49}{12}
   \]

8. Thus, we have:
   \[
   3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{49}{12}
   \]

From this expression, we can identify \(k\):
\[
k = -\frac{49}{12}

Problem: A triangle is formed with edges along the line $y=\frac{2}{3}x+5$, the $x$-axis, and the line $x=k$. If the area of the triangle is less than $20$, find the sum of all possible integral values of $k$.
Model Response: To find the area of the triangle formed by the line \( y = \frac{2}{3}x + 5 \), the \( x \)-axis, and the line \( x = k \), we first need to determine the points of intersection.

1. **Find the intersection of the line with the \( x \)-axis**:
   Set \( y = 0 \):
   \[
   0 = \frac{2}{3}x + 5 \implies \frac{2}{3}x = -5 \implies x = -\frac{15}{2} = -7.5.
   \]
   Thus, the intersection point is \( \left(-\frac{15}{2}, 0\right) \).

2. **Find the intersection of the line with \( x = k \)**:
   Substitute \( x = k \) into the line equation:
   \[
   y = \frac{2}{3}k + 5.
   \]
   The intersection point is \( (k, \frac{2}{3}k + 5) \).

3. **Calculate the area of the triangle**:
   The base of the triangle is the horizontal distance from \( x = -\frac{15}{2} \) to \( x = k \), which is:
   \[
   \text{Base} = k + \frac{15}{2}.
   \]
   The height of the triangle is the \( y \)-coordinate of the intersection point with the line \( x = k \):
   \[
   \text{Height} = \frac{2}{3}k + 5.
   \]
   The area \( A \) of the triangle is given by:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height} = \frac{1}{2} \left(k + \frac{15}{2}\right) \left(\frac{2}{3}k + 5\right).
   \]

4. **Set up the inequality for the area**:
   We want the area to be less than 20:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left(k + \frac{15}{2}\right) \left(\frac{2}{3}k + 5\right) < 20.
   \]

Problem: Lana defines a function $f(x)$ which is given by the formula $$f(x) = x^2,$$ but only on a domain she has specified which consists of finitely many values $x$; she leaves the function undefined for all other $x$.

Given that the range of $f(x)$ is $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$, what is the maximum number of points that could be in its domain?
Model Response: To determine the maximum number of points that could be in the domain of the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) given that the range is \( \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\} \), we need to find the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) \) produces each of these outputs.

The function \( f(x) = x^2 \) produces the following outputs for integer values of \( x \):

- \( f(0) = 0^2 = 0 \)
- \( f(1) = 1^2 = 1 \)
- \( f(-1) = (-1)^2 = 1 \)
- \( f(2) = 2^2 = 4 \)
- \( f(-2) = (-2)^2 = 4 \)
- \( f(3) = 3^2 = 9 \)
- \( f(-3) = (-3)^2 = 9 \)

Now, we can summarize the outputs:

- \( 0 \) from \( x = 0 \)
- \( 1 \) from \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -1 \)
- \( 2 \) has no corresponding \( x \) (not achievable)
- \( 3 \) has no corresponding \( x \) (not achievable)
- \( 4 \) from \( x = 2 \) and \( x = -2 \)
- \( 5 \) has no corresponding \( x \) (not achievable)
- \( 6 \) has no corresponding \( x \) (not achievable)
- \( 7 \) has no corresponding \( x \) (not achievable)
- \( 8 \) has no corresponding \( x \) (not achievable)
- \( 9 \) from \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -3 \)

Now, we can count the distinct \( x \) values that produce the outputs in the range:

- For \( 0 \): \( 1 \) point (0)
- For \( 1 \): \( 2 \) points (1, -1)
- For \( 4 \): \( 2 \) points (2, -2)
- For \( 9 \): \( 2 \) points (3, -3)

Adding these together gives us:

\[
1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7
\]

Thus, the maximum number of points that could be in the domain of \( f(x) \) is \( \boxed{7} \).

Problem: If $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive integers such that $6xyz+30xy+21xz+2yz+105x+10y+7z=812$, find $x+y+z$.
Model Response: To solve the equation 

\[
6xyz + 30xy + 21xz + 2yz + 105x + 10y + 7z = 812,
\]

we can start by rearranging and factoring the left-hand side. We will look for integer solutions for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).

First, we can try to factor the equation. Notice that the coefficients suggest a possible grouping. We can rewrite the equation as:

\[
6xyz + 30xy + 21xz + 2yz + 105x + 10y + 7z - 812 = 0.
\]

To find integer solutions, we can try small values for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). 

Let's start with \(x = 1\):

\[
6(1)yz + 30(1)y + 21(1)z + 2yz + 105(1) + 10y + 7z = 812.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
6yz + 30y + 21z + 2yz + 105 + 10y + 7z = 812.
\]

Combining like terms gives:

\[
(6 + 2)yz + (30 + 10)y + (21 + 7)z + 105 = 812,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
8yz + 40y + 28z + 105 = 812.
\]

Subtracting 105 from both sides:

\[
8yz + 40y + 28z = 707.
\]

Now, let's try \(y = 1\):

\[
8(1)z + 40(1) + 28z = 707.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8z + 40 + 28z = 707,
\]

which gives:

\[
36z + 40 = 707.
\]

Subtracting 40 from both sides:

\[
36z = 667.
\]

Dividing by 36:

\[
z = \frac{667}{36} \text{ (not an integer)}.
\]

Next, let's try \(y = 2\):

\[
8(2)z + 40(2) + 28z = 707.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
16z + 80 + 28z = 707,
\]

which gives:

\[
44z + 80 = 707.
\]

Subtracting 80 from both sides:

\[
44z = 627.
\]

Dividing by 44:

\[
z = \frac{627}{44} \text{ (not an integer)}.
\]

Next, let's try \(y = 3\):

\[
8(3)z + 40(3) + 28z = 707.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
24z + 120 + 28z = 707,
\]

which gives:

\[
52z + 120 = 707.
\]

Problem: The polynomial $p(x) = x^2+ax+b$ has distinct roots $2a$ and $b$. Find $a+b$.
Model Response: To find \( a + b \) for the polynomial \( p(x) = x^2 + ax + b \) with distinct roots \( 2a \) and \( b \), we can use Vieta's formulas. According to Vieta's, the sum of the roots is equal to the negation of the coefficient of \( x \) divided by the leading coefficient, and the product of the roots is equal to the constant term divided by the leading coefficient.

1. **Sum of the roots**:
   \[
   2a + b = -a
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   3a + b = 0 \quad \text{(1)}
   \]

2. **Product of the roots**:
   \[
   (2a) \cdot b = b
   \]
   Assuming \( b \neq 0 \) (since the roots are distinct), we can divide both sides by \( b \):
   \[
   2a = 1 \quad \text{(2)}
   \]

From equation (2), we can solve for \( a \):
\[
a = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Now, substituting \( a \) back into equation (1):
\[
3\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + b = 0
\]
\[
\frac{3}{2} + b = 0
\]
\[
b = -\frac{3}{2}
\]

Now we can find \( a + b \):
\[
a + b = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{3}{2} = -1
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{-1}

Problem: A ball is dropped straight down from a height of 16 feet. If it bounces back each time to a height one-half the height from which it last fell, how far will the ball have traveled when it hits the floor for the sixth time, in feet?
Model Response: To find the total distance traveled by the ball when it hits the floor for the sixth time, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. The ball is dropped from a height of 16 feet.
2. It bounces back to half the height after each fall.

Let's calculate the distances for each fall and bounce:

- **First drop:** The ball falls 16 feet.
- **First bounce:** The ball bounces back to \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) feet.
- **Second drop:** The ball falls 8 feet.
- **Second bounce:** The ball bounces back to \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) feet.
- **Third drop:** The ball falls 4 feet.
- **Third bounce:** The ball bounces back to \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) feet.
- **Fourth drop:** The ball falls 2 feet.
- **Fourth bounce:** The ball bounces back to \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) foot.
- **Fifth drop:** The ball falls 1 foot.
- **Fifth bounce:** The ball bounces back to \( \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \) feet.
- **Sixth drop:** The ball falls 0.5 feet.

Now, we can sum up the distances:

- Distance traveled during drops:
  - First drop: 16 feet
  - Second drop: 8 feet
  - Third drop: 4 feet
  - Fourth drop: 2 feet
  - Fifth drop: 1 foot
  - Sixth drop: 0.5 feet

Total distance for drops:
\[
16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 0.5 = 31.5 \text{ feet}
\]

- Distance traveled during bounces (only up to the fifth bounce, since we stop after the sixth drop):
  - First bounce: 8 feet
  - Second bounce: 4 feet
  - Third bounce: 2 feet
  - Fourth bounce: 1 foot
  - Fifth bounce: 0.5 feet

Total distance for bounces:
\[
8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 0.5 = 15.5 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we add the total distances from drops and bounces:
\[
31.5 + 15.5 = 47 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the total distance traveled by the ball when it hits the floor for the sixth time is \(\boxed{47}\) feet.

Problem: The quadratic $3x^2-24x+72$ can be written in the form $a(x+b)^2+c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. What is $a+b+c$?
Model Response: To rewrite the quadratic \(3x^2 - 24x + 72\) in the form \(a(x+b)^2+c\), we first factor out the coefficient of \(x^2\) from the first two terms:

\[
3(x^2 - 8x) + 72.
\]

Next, we complete the square for the expression inside the parentheses. To do this, we take half of the coefficient of \(x\) (which is \(-8\)), square it, and add and subtract it inside the parentheses:

\[
3\left(x^2 - 8x + 16 - 16\right) + 72 = 3\left((x-4)^2 - 16\right) + 72.
\]

Distributing the \(3\) gives:

\[
3(x-4)^2 - 48 + 72 = 3(x-4)^2 + 24.
\]

Now we have the quadratic in the desired form:

\[
a = 3, \quad b = -4, \quad c = 24.
\]

To find \(a + b + c\):

\[
a + b + c = 3 - 4 + 24 = 23.

Thus, the final answer is:

Problem: Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are nonzero real numbers, and that the equation  $${x^2 + ax + b = 0}$$ has solutions $a$ and $b$. Then what is the pair $(a,b)$?
Model Response: Given the quadratic equation \(x^2 + ax + b = 0\) with solutions \(a\) and \(b\), we can use Vieta's formulas, which state that for a quadratic equation \(x^2 + px + q = 0\), the sum of the roots is \(-p\) and the product of the roots is \(q\).

From Vieta's formulas, we have:
1. The sum of the roots \(a + b = -a\)
2. The product of the roots \(ab = b\)

From the first equation, we can rearrange it:
\[
a + b = -a \implies 2a + b = 0 \implies b = -2a
\]

Now substituting \(b = -2a\) into the second equation:
\[
a(-2a) = b \implies -2a^2 = -2a
\]
Dividing both sides by \(-2\) (since \(a\) is nonzero):
\[
a^2 = a
\]
This gives us:
\[
a^2 - a = 0 \implies a(a - 1) = 0
\]
Thus, \(a = 0\) or \(a = 1\). Since \(a\) is nonzero, we have \(a = 1\).

Now substituting \(a = 1\) back into the equation for \(b\):
\[
b = -2(1) = -2
\]

Thus, the pair \((a, b)\) is \((1, -2)\).

The final answer is:

Problem: The $n^{\text{th}}$ term of a certain geometric series is given by $a\cdot r^{n-1}$, where $a$ and $r$ are positive integers and $r$ is greater than 1. Bill picks out $k$ different numbers in this sequence, all of which have the same number of digits. What is the largest possible value of $k$?
Model Response: To find the largest possible value of \( k \) such that Bill can pick \( k \) different numbers from the geometric series \( a \cdot r^{n-1} \) with the same number of digits, we need to analyze the conditions under which the terms of the series have the same number of digits.

The number of digits \( d \) of a number \( x \) can be determined using the formula:
\[
d = \lfloor \log_{10} x \rfloor + 1
\]
For the \( n^{\text{th}} \) term of the geometric series, we have:
\[
x_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}
\]
The number of digits in \( x_n \) is:
\[
d_n = \lfloor \log_{10} (a \cdot r^{n-1}) \rfloor + 1 = \lfloor \log_{10} a + (n-1) \log_{10} r \rfloor + 1
\]

For \( k \) different terms \( x_{n_1}, x_{n_2}, \ldots, x_{n_k} \) to have the same number of digits, we need:
\[
\lfloor \log_{10} a + (n_i - 1) \log_{10} r \rfloor = \lfloor \log_{10} a + (n_j - 1) \log_{10} r \rfloor \quad \text{for all } i, j
\]

This implies that the fractional parts of \( \log_{10} a + (n_i - 1) \log_{10} r \) must be the same for all \( i \). 

Let \( b = \log_{10} r \). Then we can rewrite the condition as:
\[
\lfloor \log_{10} a + (n_i - 1) b \rfloor = \lfloor \log_{10} a + (n_j - 1) b \rfloor
\]

This means that the difference between \( (n_i - 1) b \) and \( (n_j - 1) b \) must be less than 1:
\[
|(n_i - 1) b - (n_j - 1) b| < 1
\]
or equivalently,
\[
|n_i - n_j| < \frac{1}{b}
\]

Since \( b = \log_{10} r \) and \( r > 1 \), \( b \) is positive. The maximum integer \( k \) such that \( |n_i - n_j| < \frac{1}{b} \) can be found by considering the largest integer \( k \) satisfying:
\[
k - 1 < \frac{1}{b} \implies k < \frac{1}{b} + 1
\]

Thus, the largest possible value of \( k \) is:
\[
k = \lfloor \frac{1}{b} \rfloor + 1 = \lfloor \frac{1}{\log_{10} r} \rfloor + 1
\]

As \( r \) increases, \( \log_{10} r \) increases, and thus \( \frac{1}{\log_{10} r} \) decreases. The maximum occurs when \( r \) is as small as possible, which is just above 1. 

For \( r = 2 \

Problem: If $a+b=7$ and $a^3+b^3=42$, what is the value of the sum $\dfrac{1}{a}+\dfrac{1}{b}$?  Express your answer as a common fraction.
Model Response: To find the value of \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}\), we can start by using the identity:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{a+b}{ab}
\]

Given that \(a + b = 7\), we need to find \(ab\). We can use the identity for the sum of cubes:

\[
a^3 + b^3 = (a+b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)
\]

We can express \(a^2 + b^2\) in terms of \(a + b\) and \(ab\):

\[
a^2 + b^2 = (a+b)^2 - 2ab = 7^2 - 2ab = 49 - 2ab
\]

Substituting this into the sum of cubes formula gives:

\[
a^3 + b^3 = (a+b)((a^2 + b^2) - ab) = (7)((49 - 2ab) - ab) = 7(49 - 3ab)
\]

We know \(a^3 + b^3 = 42\), so we can set up the equation:

\[
7(49 - 3ab) = 42
\]

Dividing both sides by 7:

\[
49 - 3ab = 6
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
3ab = 49 - 6 = 43 \implies ab = \frac{43}{3}
\]

Now we can substitute \(a + b\) and \(ab\) back into the expression for \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}\):

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{a+b}{ab} = \frac{7}{\frac{43}{3}} = 7 \cdot \frac{3}{43} = \frac{21}{43}

Problem: Let $p(x)=\sqrt{-x}$, and $q(x)=8x^2+10x-3$. The domain of $p(q(x))$ can be written in the form $a\le x \le b$. Find $b-a$.
Model Response: To find the domain of \( p(q(x)) \), we first need to determine the conditions under which \( p(x) = \sqrt{-x} \) is defined. The function \( p(x) \) is defined when its argument is non-negative, i.e., 

\[
-q(x) \geq 0 \implies q(x) \leq 0.
\]

Next, we need to analyze the quadratic function \( q(x) = 8x^2 + 10x - 3 \). To find the values of \( x \) for which \( q(x) \leq 0 \), we first find the roots of the equation \( q(x) = 0 \).

Using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{10^2 - 4 \cdot 8 \cdot (-3)}}{2 \cdot 8}.
\]

Calculating the discriminant:

\[
b^2 - 4ac = 100 + 96 = 196.
\]

Now substituting back into the formula:

\[
x = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{196}}{16} = \frac{-10 \pm 14}{16}.
\]

This gives us two roots:

\[
x_1 = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4}, \quad x_2 = \frac{-24}{16} = -\frac{3}{2}.
\]

The roots of the quadratic \( q(x) \) are \( x = -\frac{3}{2} \) and \( x = \frac{1}{4} \). Since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive (8), the parabola opens upwards. Therefore, \( q(x) \leq 0 \) between the roots:

\[
-\frac{3}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Now, we can express the domain of \( p(q(x)) \) as:

\[
a = -\frac{3}{2}, \quad b = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

To find \( b - a \):

\[
b - a = \frac{1}{4} - \left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{6}{4} = \frac{7}{4}.

Model Response: To rewrite the expression \(-2x^2 - 20x - 53\) in the form \(a(x+d)^2 + e\), we first factor out \(-2\) from the quadratic terms:

\[
-2(x^2 + 10x) - 53
\]

Next, we complete the square for the expression inside the parentheses. To do this, we take half of the coefficient of \(x\) (which is \(10\)), square it, and add and subtract that value inside the parentheses:

\[
-2\left(x^2 + 10x + 25 - 25\right) - 53
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-2\left((x + 5)^2 - 25\right) - 53
\]

Distributing the \(-2\):

\[
-2(x + 5)^2 + 50 - 53
\]

Combining the constants gives:

\[
-2(x + 5)^2 - 3
\]

Now we can identify the constants \(a\), \(d\), and \(e\):

- \(a = -2\)
- \(d = 5\)
- \(e = -3\)

Now, we find the sum \(a + d + e\):

\[
a + d + e = -2 + 5 - 3 = 0

Problem: Sue can either borrow $10,\!000$ dollars for $5$ years with a simple interest of $7\%$ annually or an interest which compounds annually for $6\%$. How much more money, rounded to the nearest dollar, would she have to pay back for the more expensive interest than the less expensive interest?
Model Response: To find out how much more money Sue would have to pay back for the more expensive interest than the less expensive interest, we will calculate the total amount to be paid back for both the simple interest and the compound interest.

1. **Simple Interest Calculation:**
   The formula for simple interest is given by:
   \[
   A = P(1 + rt)
   \]
   where:
   - \( P = 10,000 \) (the principal),
   - \( r = 0.07 \) (the annual interest rate),
   - \( t = 5 \) (the time in years).

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   A = 10,000(1 + 0.07 \times 5) = 10,000(1 + 0.35) = 10,000 \times 1.35 = 13,500
   \]

2. **Compound Interest Calculation:**
   The formula for compound interest is given by:
   \[
   A = P(1 + r)^t
   \]
   where:
   - \( P = 10,000 \) (the principal),
   - \( r = 0.06 \) (the annual interest rate),
   - \( t = 5 \) (the time in years).

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   A = 10,000(1 + 0.06)^5 = 10,000(1.06)^5
   \]
   First, we calculate \( (1.06)^5 \):
   \[
   (1.06)^5 \approx 1.338225
   \]
   Now, substituting this back into the formula:
   \[
   A \approx 10,000 \times 1.338225 \approx 13,382.25
   \]

3. **Calculating the Difference:**
   Now we find the difference between the amounts to be paid back:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 13,500 - 13,382.25 \approx 117.75
   \]

   Rounding to the nearest dollar, the difference is:
   \[
   \text{Difference} \approx 118

Problem: Suppose $x$ is a solution to $x^2 + 1 = 7x$. What is the sum of $x$ and its reciprocal?
Model Response: To solve the equation \( x^2 + 1 = 7x \), we first rearrange it into standard form:

\[
x^2 - 7x + 1 = 0.
\]

Next, we can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},
\]

where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), and \( c = 1 \). Plugging in these values gives:

\[
x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 - 4}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{45}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm 3\sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Thus, the two solutions for \( x \) are:

\[
x_1 = \frac{7 + 3\sqrt{5}}{2}, \quad x_2 = \frac{7 - 3\sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Next, we need to find the sum of \( x \) and its reciprocal \( \frac{1}{x} \). The sum can be expressed as:

\[
x + \frac{1}{x} = x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{x^2 + 1}{x}.
\]

We already have \( x^2 = 7x - 1 \) from the original equation. Therefore, we can substitute \( x^2 \) into the expression:

\[
x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{(7x - 1) + 1}{x} = \frac{7x}{x} = 7.
\]

Thus, the sum of \( x \) and its reciprocal is:

\[
\boxed{7}.

Problem: If we express $3x^2 + x - 4$ in the form $a(x - h)^2 + k$, then what is $k$?
Model Response: To express the quadratic \(3x^2 + x - 4\) in the form \(a(x - h)^2 + k\), we will complete the square.

1. Start with the quadratic:
   \[
   3x^2 + x - 4
   \]

2. Factor out the coefficient of \(x^2\) (which is 3) from the first two terms:
   \[
   3\left(x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x\right) - 4
   \]

3. To complete the square inside the parentheses, take half of the coefficient of \(x\) (which is \(\frac{1}{3}\)), square it, and add and subtract it inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \text{Half of } \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6}, \quad \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{36}
   \]
   So we rewrite the expression:
   \[
   3\left(x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{36} - \frac{1}{36}\right) - 4
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   3\left(\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{36}\right) - 4
   \]

4. Distributing the 3:
   \[
   3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{1}{36} - 4
   \]
   \[
   = 3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{12} - 4
   \]

5. Convert \(-4\) to a fraction with a denominator of 12:
   \[
   -4 = -\frac{48}{12}
   \]
   Thus, we have:
   \[
   3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{12} - \frac{48}{12} = 3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{49}{12}
   \]

Now, we can identify \(k\) from the completed square form \(a(x - h)^2 + k\):
- Here, \(k = -\frac{49}{12}\).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{-\frac{49}{12}}

Problem: A triangle is formed with edges along the line $y=\frac{2}{3}x+5$, the $x$-axis, and the line $x=k$. If the area of the triangle is less than $20$, find the sum of all possible integral values of $k$.
Model Response: To find the area of the triangle formed by the line \( y = \frac{2}{3}x + 5 \), the \( x \)-axis, and the line \( x = k \), we first need to determine the points of intersection.

1. **Find the intersection of the line with the \( x \)-axis**:
   Set \( y = 0 \):
   \[
   0 = \frac{2}{3}x + 5 \implies \frac{2}{3}x = -5 \implies x = -\frac{15}{2} = -7.5.
   \]
   Thus, the intersection point is \( \left(-\frac{15}{2}, 0\right) \).

2. **Find the intersection of the line \( y = \frac{2}{3}x + 5 \) with the line \( x = k \)**:
   Substitute \( x = k \) into the line equation:
   \[
   y = \frac{2}{3}k + 5.
   \]
   The intersection point is \( (k, \frac{2}{3}k + 5) \).

3. **Determine the area of the triangle**:
   The base of the triangle is the horizontal distance from \( x = -\frac{15}{2} \) to \( x = k \), which is:
   \[
   \text{Base} = k + \frac{15}{2} = k + 7.5.
   \]
   The height of the triangle is the \( y \)-coordinate of the point \( (k, \frac{2}{3}k + 5) \):
   \[
   \text{Height} = \frac{2}{3}k + 5.
   \]
   The area \( A \) of the triangle is given by:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height} = \frac{1}{2} \times \left(k + 7.5\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}k + 5\right).
   \]
   We want this area to be less than \( 20 \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times (k + 7.5) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}k + 5\right) < 20.
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by \( 2 \):
   \[
   (k + 7.5) \left(\frac{2}{3}k + 5\right) < 40.
   \]

4. **Expand the left-hand side**:
   \[
   (k + 7.5) \left(\frac{2}{3}k + 5\right) = \frac{2}{3}k^2 + 5k + 5 \cdot 7.5 + \frac{15}{2}k = \frac{2}{3}k^2 + 5k + 37.5.
   \]
   Thus, we have:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}k^2 + 5k + 37.5 < 40.
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}k^2 + 5k - 2.5 < 0.

Problem: Lana defines a function $f(x)$ which is given by the formula $$f(x) = x^2,$$ but only on a domain she has specified which consists of finitely many values $x$; she leaves the function undefined for all other $x$.

Given that the range of $f(x)$ is $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$, what is the maximum number of points that could be in its domain?
Model Response: To determine the maximum number of points that could be in the domain of the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) given that the range is \( \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\} \), we need to find the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) \) produces outputs within this range.

The function \( f(x) = x^2 \) produces non-negative outputs. We can find the values of \( x \) that yield outputs in the specified range by solving the equations:

1. \( x^2 = 0 \) gives \( x = 0 \)
2. \( x^2 = 1 \) gives \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -1 \)
3. \( x^2 = 2 \) gives \( x = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \)
4. \( x^2 = 3 \) gives \( x = \sqrt{3} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{3} \)
5. \( x^2 = 4 \) gives \( x = 2 \) and \( x = -2 \)
6. \( x^2 = 5 \) gives \( x = \sqrt{5} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{5} \)
7. \( x^2 = 6 \) gives \( x = \sqrt{6} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{6} \)
8. \( x^2 = 7 \) gives \( x = \sqrt{7} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{7} \)
9. \( x^2 = 8 \) gives \( x = \sqrt{8} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{8} \)
10. \( x^2 = 9 \) gives \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -3 \)

Now, we count the distinct values of \( x \) that can be included in the domain:

- From \( x^2 = 0 \): 1 value (0)
- From \( x^2 = 1 \): 2 values (1, -1)
- From \( x^2 = 2 \): 2 values (\(\sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2}\))
- From \( x^2 = 3 \): 2 values (\(\sqrt{3}, -\sqrt{3}\))
- From \( x^2 = 4 \): 2 values (2, -2)
- From \( x^2 = 5 \): 2 values (\(\sqrt{5}, -\sqrt{5}\))
- From \( x^2 = 6 \): 2 values (\(\sqrt{6}, -\sqrt{6}\))
- From \( x^2 = 7 \): 2 values (\(\sqrt{7}, -\sqrt{7}\))
- From \( x^2 = 8 \): 2 values (\(\sqrt{8}, -\sqrt{8}\))
- From \( x^2 = 9 \): 2 values (3, -3)

Now, we sum these values:

\[
1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 1 + 18 = 19

Problem: If $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive integers such that $6xyz+30xy+21xz+2yz+105x+10y+7z=812$, find $x+y+z$.
Model Response: To solve the equation \(6xyz + 30xy + 21xz + 2yz + 105x + 10y + 7z = 812\), we can start by rearranging and factoring the left-hand side.

We can rewrite the equation as follows:

\[
6xyz + 30xy + 21xz + 2yz + 105x + 10y + 7z - 812 = 0.
\]

Next, we will try to factor the left-hand side. We can group the terms in a way that might help us factor them:

\[
6xyz + 30xy + 21xz + 2yz + 105x + 10y + 7z = 812.
\]

We can factor out common terms from some of the groups:

1. From \(6xyz + 30xy\), we can factor out \(6xy\):
   \[
   6xy(z + 5).
   \]

2. From \(21xz + 2yz\), we can factor out \(y\):
   \[
   y(21x + 2z).
   \]

3. From \(105x + 10y + 7z\), we can factor out \(1\):
   \[
   105x + 10y + 7z.
   \]

However, this approach does not lead to a clear factorization. Instead, we can try substituting small positive integer values for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) to find a solution.

Let's try \(x = 5\), \(y = 3\), and \(z = 2\):

Calculating each term:
- \(6xyz = 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 180\),
- \(30xy = 30 \cdot 5 \cdot 3 = 450\),
- \(21xz = 21 \cdot 5 \cdot 2 = 210\),
- \(2yz = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 12\),
- \(105x = 105 \cdot 5 = 525\),
- \(10y = 10 \cdot 3 = 30\),
- \(7z = 7 \cdot 2 = 14\).

Now summing these values:
\[
180 + 450 + 210 + 12 + 525 + 30 + 14 = 1421.
\]

This is too high. Let's try smaller values.

Next, let's try \(x = 3\), \(y = 5\), and \(z = 2\):

Calculating each term:
- \(6xyz = 6 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 2 = 180\),
- \(30xy = 30 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 450\),
- \(21xz = 21 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 126\),
- \(2yz = 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 2 = 20\),
- \(105x = 105 \cdot 3 = 315\),
- \(10y = 10 \cdot 5 = 50\),
- \(7z = 7 \cdot 2 = 14\).

Now summing these values:

180 + 450 + 126 + 20 + 315 + 50 + 14 = 1155.

Problem: The polynomial $p(x) = x^2+ax+b$ has distinct roots $2a$ and $b$. Find $a+b$.
Model Response: To find \( a + b \) given that the polynomial \( p(x) = x^2 + ax + b \) has distinct roots \( 2a \) and \( b \), we can use Vieta's formulas.

According to Vieta's formulas, for a quadratic polynomial \( x^2 + px + q \) with roots \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \):
- The sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 = -p \)
- The product of the roots \( r_1 r_2 = q \)

In our case, the roots are \( 2a \) and \( b \). Therefore, we have:
1. \( 2a + b = -a \)
2. \( 2a \cdot b = b \)

From the second equation, we can analyze two cases:

**Case 1:** \( b \neq 0 \)

If \( b \neq 0 \), we can divide both sides of the equation \( 2a \cdot b = b \) by \( b \):
\[
2a = 1 \implies a = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Substituting \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) into the first equation:
\[
2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + b = -\frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
1 + b = -\frac{1}{2} \implies b = -\frac{1}{2} - 1 = -\frac{3}{2}
\]

Now we have \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( b = -\frac{3}{2} \). Thus:
\[
a + b = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{3}{2} = -1
\]

**Case 2:** \( b = 0 \)

If \( b = 0 \), then the first equation becomes:
\[
2a + 0 = -a \implies 3a = 0 \implies a = 0
\]
In this case, \( a + b = 0 + 0 = 0 \).

However, we need distinct roots, and if \( b = 0 \), the roots would be \( 2a \) and \( 0 \), which are not distinct unless \( a \neq 0 \). Thus, this case does not yield valid distinct roots.

Therefore, the only valid solution is from Case 1, where \( a + b = -1 \).

Thus, the final answer is:

Problem: A ball is dropped straight down from a height of 16 feet. If it bounces back each time to a height one-half the height from which it last fell, how far will the ball have traveled when it hits the floor for the sixth time, in feet?
Model Response: To find the total distance traveled by the ball when it hits the floor for the sixth time, we can analyze the sequence of bounces.

1. The ball is dropped from a height of 16 feet. It falls this distance to the ground:
   - Distance fallen: \(16\) feet.

2. After hitting the ground, it bounces back to half the height:
   - Height after first bounce: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) feet.
   - Distance traveled upwards: \(8\) feet.

3. It then falls back down from this height:
   - Distance fallen: \(8\) feet.

4. The ball bounces back again to half the height:
   - Height after second bounce: \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) feet.
   - Distance traveled upwards: \(4\) feet.

5. It falls back down from this height:
   - Distance fallen: \(4\) feet.

6. The ball bounces back to half the height again:
   - Height after third bounce: \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) feet.
   - Distance traveled upwards: \(2\) feet.

7. It falls back down from this height:
   - Distance fallen: \(2\) feet.

8. The ball bounces back to half the height again:
   - Height after fourth bounce: \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) foot.
   - Distance traveled upwards: \(1\) foot.

9. It falls back down from this height:
   - Distance fallen: \(1\) foot.

10. The ball bounces back to half the height again:
    - Height after fifth bounce: \( \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \) feet.
    - Distance traveled upwards: \(0.5\) feet.

11. It falls back down from this height:
    - Distance fallen: \(0.5\) feet.

Now, we can sum all the distances traveled:

- Distance fallen: \(16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 0.5 = 31.5\) feet.
- Distance bounced back up: \(8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 0.5 = 15.5\) feet.

The total distance traveled by the ball when it hits the floor for the sixth time is:

\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance fallen} + \text{Distance bounced back} = 31.5 + 15.5 = 47 \text{ feet}.

Problem: The quadratic $3x^2-24x+72$ can be written in the form $a(x+b)^2+c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. What is $a+b+c$?
Model Response: To rewrite the quadratic \(3x^2 - 24x + 72\) in the form \(a(x+b)^2+c\), we start by factoring out the coefficient of \(x^2\) from the first two terms:

\[
3(x^2 - 8x) + 72
\]

Next, we complete the square for the expression inside the parentheses. To do this, we take half of the coefficient of \(x\) (which is \(-8\)), square it, and add and subtract that value inside the parentheses:

\[
3\left(x^2 - 8x + 16 - 16\right) + 72
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3\left((x - 4)^2 - 16\right) + 72
\]

Distributing the \(3\):

\[
3(x - 4)^2 - 48 + 72
\]

Combining the constants gives:

\[
3(x - 4)^2 + 24
\]

Now we have the quadratic in the desired form \(a(x+b)^2+c\) where \(a = 3\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = 24\).

To find \(a + b + c\):

\[
a + b + c = 3 + (-4) + 24 = 3 - 4 + 24 = 23

Problem: Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are nonzero real numbers, and that the equation  $${x^2 + ax + b = 0}$$ has solutions $a$ and $b$. Then what is the pair $(a,b)$?
Model Response: Given the quadratic equation \(x^2 + ax + b = 0\) with solutions \(a\) and \(b\), we can use Vieta's formulas, which state that for a quadratic equation \(x^2 + px + q = 0\), the sum of the roots is \(-p\) and the product of the roots is \(q\).

From Vieta's formulas, we have:
1. The sum of the roots \(a + b = -a\)
2. The product of the roots \(ab = b\)

From the first equation, we can rearrange it:
\[
a + b + a = 0 \implies 2a + b = 0 \implies b = -2a
\]

Now substituting \(b = -2a\) into the second equation:
\[
a(-2a) = -2a
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-2a^2 = -2a
\]
Dividing both sides by \(-2\) (noting that \(a \neq 0\)):
\[
a^2 = a
\]
This gives us:
\[
a^2 - a = 0 \implies a(a - 1) = 0
\]
Thus, \(a = 0\) or \(a = 1\). Since \(a\) is nonzero, we have \(a = 1\).

Now substituting \(a = 1\) back into the equation for \(b\):
\[
b = -2(1) = -2
\]

Thus, the pair \((a, b)\) is \((1, -2)\).

Problem: The $n^{\text{th}}$ term of a certain geometric series is given by $a\cdot r^{n-1}$, where $a$ and $r$ are positive integers and $r$ is greater than 1. Bill picks out $k$ different numbers in this sequence, all of which have the same number of digits. What is the largest possible value of $k$?
Model Response: To find the largest possible value of \( k \) such that Bill can pick \( k \) different numbers from the geometric series \( a \cdot r^{n-1} \) with the same number of digits, we need to analyze the conditions under which the numbers in the series have the same number of digits.

The number of digits \( d \) of a number \( x \) can be determined using the formula:
\[
d = \lfloor \log_{10} x \rfloor + 1
\]
For the terms in the geometric series, we have:
\[
x_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}
\]
The number of digits in \( x_n \) is:
\[
d_n = \lfloor \log_{10} (a \cdot r^{n-1}) \rfloor + 1 = \lfloor \log_{10} a + (n-1) \log_{10} r \rfloor + 1
\]

For \( k \) different terms \( x_{n_1}, x_{n_2}, \ldots, x_{n_k} \) to have the same number of digits, we need:
\[
\lfloor \log_{10} a + (n_1 - 1) \log_{10} r \rfloor = \lfloor \log_{10} a + (n_2 - 1) \log_{10} r \rfloor = \ldots = \lfloor \log_{10} a + (n_k - 1) \log_{10} r \rfloor
\]

This implies that the fractional parts of \( \log_{10} a + (n_i - 1) \log_{10} r \) must fall within the same integer range. 

Let \( b = \log_{10} r \). The condition can be rewritten as:
\[
\lfloor \log_{10} a + (n_i - 1) b \rfloor = m \quad \text{for some integer } m
\]
This means:
\[
m \leq \log_{10} a + (n_i - 1) b < m + 1
\]
Rearranging gives:
\[
m - \log_{10} a < (n_i - 1) b < m + 1 - \log_{10} a
\]
Dividing by \( b \) (since \( b > 0 \)):
\[
\frac{m - \log_{10} a}{b} < n_i - 1 < \frac{m + 1 - \log_{10} a}{b}
\]
Thus:
\[
\frac{m - \log_{10} a}{b} + 1 < n_i < \frac{m + 1 - \log_{10} a}{b} + 1
\]

The range of \( n_i \) values is:
\[
\left( \frac{m - \log_{10} a}{b} + 1, \frac{m + 1 - \log_{10} a}{b} + 1 \right)
\]
The length of this interval is:
\[
\frac{(m + 1 - \log_{10} a) - (m - \log_{10} a)}{b} = \frac{1}{b}
\]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, the maximum number of integers \( n_i \) that can fit in this interval is:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{1}{b} \right\rfloor
\]

To maximize \( k \), we need to minimize \( b = \log_{10} r \). The smallest integer \( r \) can be is \( 2 \) (since \( r \) must be greater than 1). Thus:
\[
b = \log_{10} 2 \approx 0.301
\]
Then:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{1}{\log_{10} 2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{1}{0.301} \right\rfloor \approx \left\lfloor 3.32 \right\rfloor = 3
\]

Problem: If $a+b=7$ and $a^3+b^3=42$, what is the value of the sum $\dfrac{1}{a}+\dfrac{1}{b}$?  Express your answer as a common fraction.
Model Response: To solve for \( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} \), we start with the given equations:

1. \( a + b = 7 \)
2. \( a^3 + b^3 = 42 \)

We can use the identity for the sum of cubes:

\[
a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)
\]

Substituting \( a + b = 7 \) into the equation gives:

\[
a^3 + b^3 = 7(a^2 - ab + b^2)
\]

Next, we can express \( a^2 + b^2 \) in terms of \( a + b \) and \( ab \):

\[
a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab = 7^2 - 2ab = 49 - 2ab
\]

Now substituting this into the sum of cubes equation:

\[
a^3 + b^3 = 7\left((49 - 2ab) - ab\right) = 7(49 - 3ab)
\]

Setting this equal to 42:

\[
7(49 - 3ab) = 42
\]

Dividing both sides by 7:

\[
49 - 3ab = 6
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
3ab = 49 - 6 = 43 \quad \Rightarrow \quad ab = \frac{43}{3}
\]

Now we need to find \( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} \):

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{a + b}{ab} = \frac{7}{\frac{43}{3}} = 7 \cdot \frac{3}{43} = \frac{21}{43}

Problem: Let $p(x)=\sqrt{-x}$, and $q(x)=8x^2+10x-3$. The domain of $p(q(x))$ can be written in the form $a\le x \le b$. Find $b-a$.
Model Response: To find the domain of \( p(q(x)) \), we first need to determine the conditions under which \( p(x) = \sqrt{-x} \) is defined. The function \( p(x) \) is defined when its argument is non-negative, i.e., 

\[
-q(x) \geq 0 \implies q(x) \leq 0.
\]

Next, we need to analyze the quadratic function \( q(x) = 8x^2 + 10x - 3 \). To find the values of \( x \) for which \( q(x) \leq 0 \), we first find the roots of the quadratic equation \( 8x^2 + 10x - 3 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{10^2 - 4 \cdot 8 \cdot (-3)}}{2 \cdot 8}.
\]

Calculating the discriminant:

\[
b^2 - 4ac = 100 + 96 = 196.
\]

Now substituting back into the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{196}}{16} = \frac{-10 \pm 14}{16}.
\]

This gives us two roots:

\[
x_1 = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4}, \quad x_2 = \frac{-24}{16} = -\frac{3}{2}.
\]

The roots of the quadratic are \( x = -\frac{3}{2} \) and \( x = \frac{1}{4} \). Since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive (8), the parabola opens upwards. Therefore, \( q(x) \leq 0 \) between the roots:

\[
-\frac{3}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Thus, the domain of \( p(q(x)) \) is:

\[
\left[-\frac{3}{2}, \frac{1}{4}\right].
\]

To find \( b - a \), where \( a = -\frac{3}{2} \) and \( b = \frac{1}{4} \):

\[
b - a = \frac{1}{4} - \left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{6}{4} = \frac{7}{4}.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{7}{4}}.

Problem: When the expression $-2x^2-20x-53$ is written in the form $a(x+d)^2+e$, where $a$, $d$, and $e$ are constants, what is the sum $a+d+e$?
Model Response: To rewrite the expression \(-2x^2 - 20x - 53\) in the form \(a(x+d)^2 + e\), we first factor out \(-2\) from the quadratic terms:

\[
-2(x^2 + 10x) - 53.
\]

Next, we complete the square for the expression inside the parentheses. To do this, we take half of the coefficient of \(x\) (which is \(10\)), square it, and add and subtract that value inside the parentheses:

\[
-2\left(x^2 + 10x + 25 - 25\right) - 53 = -2\left((x + 5)^2 - 25\right) - 53.
\]

Now, we distribute the \(-2\):

\[
-2(x + 5)^2 + 50 - 53 = -2(x + 5)^2 - 3.
\]

Thus, we have the expression in the desired form:

\[
a = -2, \quad d = 5, \quad e = -3.
\]

Now, we calculate the sum \(a + d + e\):

\[
a + d + e = -2 + 5 - 3 = 0.
\]

Finally, the answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}.

Problem: Sue can either borrow $10,\!000$ dollars for $5$ years with a simple interest of $7\%$ annually or an interest which compounds annually for $6\%$. How much more money, rounded to the nearest dollar, would she have to pay back for the more expensive interest than the less expensive interest?
Model Response: To find out how much more money Sue would have to pay back for the more expensive interest than the less expensive interest, we will calculate the total amount she would pay back for both the simple interest and the compound interest.

1. **Simple Interest Calculation:**
   The formula for simple interest is given by:
   \[
   A = P(1 + rt)
   \]
   where:
   - \( P = 10,000 \) (the principal)
   - \( r = 0.07 \) (the interest rate)
   - \( t = 5 \) (the time in years)

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   A = 10000(1 + 0.07 \cdot 5) = 10000(1 + 0.35) = 10000 \cdot 1.35 = 13500
   \]

2. **Compound Interest Calculation:**
   The formula for compound interest is given by:
   \[
   A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
   \]
   where:
   - \( P = 10,000 \) (the principal)
   - \( r = 0.06 \) (the interest rate)
   - \( n = 1 \) (the number of times interest is compounded per year)
   - \( t = 5 \) (the time in years)

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   A = 10000\left(1 + \frac{0.06}{1}\right)^{1 \cdot 5} = 10000(1 + 0.06)^{5} = 10000(1.06)^{5}
   \]
   Now we calculate \( (1.06)^{5} \):
   \[
   (1.06)^{5} \approx 1.338225
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   A \approx 10000 \cdot 1.338225 \approx 13382.25
   \]

3. **Calculating the Difference:**
   Now we find the difference between the amounts paid back for the two types of interest:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 13500 - 13382.25 \approx 117.75
   \]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the difference is approximately \( 118 \).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{118}

Problem: Suppose $x$ is a solution to $x^2 + 1 = 7x$. What is the sum of $x$ and its reciprocal?
Model Response: To solve the equation \( x^2 + 1 = 7x \), we first rearrange it into standard form:

\[
x^2 - 7x + 1 = 0.
\]

Next, we can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},
\]

where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), and \( c = 1 \). Plugging in these values, we have:

\[
x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 - 4}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{45}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm 3\sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Thus, the two solutions for \( x \) are:

\[
x_1 = \frac{7 + 3\sqrt{5}}{2}, \quad x_2 = \frac{7 - 3\sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Next, we need to find the sum of \( x \) and its reciprocal \( \frac{1}{x} \). The sum can be expressed as:

\[
x + \frac{1}{x} = x + \frac{1}{\frac{7 \pm 3\sqrt{5}}{2}} = x + \frac{2}{7 \pm 3\sqrt{5}}.
\]

To simplify \( \frac{2}{7 \pm 3\sqrt{5}} \), we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate:

\[
\frac{2(7 \mp 3\sqrt{5})}{(7 \pm 3\sqrt{5})(7 \mp 3\sqrt{5})} = \frac{2(7 \mp 3\sqrt{5})}{49 - 45} = \frac{2(7 \mp 3\sqrt{5})}{4} = \frac{7 \mp 3\sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
x + \frac{1}{x} = x + \frac{7 \mp 3\sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Now, substituting \( x = \frac{7 + 3\sqrt{5}}{2} \):

\[
x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7 + 3\sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{7 - 3\sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{(7 + 3\sqrt{5}) + (7 - 3\sqrt{5})}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7.
\]

Similarly, substituting \( x = \frac{7 - 3\sqrt{5}}{2} \):

\[
x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7 - 3\sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{7 + 3\sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{(7 - 3\sqrt{5}) + (7 + 3\sqrt{5})}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7.
\]

In both cases, we find that:

\[
x + \frac{1}{x} = 7.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{7}.

Problem: If we express $3x^2 + x - 4$ in the form $a(x - h)^2 + k$, then what is $k$?
Model Response: To express the quadratic \(3x^2 + x - 4\) in the form \(a(x - h)^2 + k\), we will complete the square.

1. Start with the quadratic:
   \[
   3x^2 + x - 4
   \]

2. Factor out the coefficient of \(x^2\) from the first two terms:
   \[
   3\left(x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x\right) - 4
   \]

3. To complete the square inside the parentheses, take half of the coefficient of \(x\) (which is \(\frac{1}{3}\)), square it, and add and subtract it inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \text{Half of } \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6}, \quad \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{36}
   \]
   Thus, we rewrite the expression:
   \[
   3\left(x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{36} - \frac{1}{36}\right) - 4
   \]

4. This simplifies to:
   \[
   3\left(\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{36}\right) - 4
   \]

5. Distributing the \(3\):
   \[
   3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{3}{36} - 4 = 3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{12} - 4
   \]

6. Convert \(-4\) to a fraction with a denominator of \(12\):
   \[
   -4 = -\frac{48}{12}
   \]

7. Combine the constants:
   \[
   -\frac{1}{12} - \frac{48}{12} = -\frac{49}{12}
   \]

8. Therefore, the expression in vertex form is:
   \[
   3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{49}{12}
   \]

From this, we can identify \(k\):
\[
k = -\frac{49}{12}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{-\frac{49}{12}}
\]

Problem: A triangle is formed with edges along the line $y=\frac{2}{3}x+5$, the $x$-axis, and the line $x=k$. If the area of the triangle is less than $20$, find the sum of all possible integral values of $k$.
Model Response: To find the area of the triangle formed by the line \(y = \frac{2}{3}x + 5\), the \(x\)-axis, and the line \(x = k\), we first need to determine the points of intersection.

1. **Find the intersection of the line with the \(x\)-axis**:
   Set \(y = 0\):
   \[
   0 = \frac{2}{3}x + 5 \implies \frac{2}{3}x = -5 \implies x = -\frac{15}{2} = -7.5.
   \]
   Thus, the intersection point is \((-7.5, 0)\).

2. **Find the intersection of the line \(y = \frac{2}{3}x + 5\) with the line \(x = k\)**:
   Substitute \(x = k\) into the line equation:
   \[
   y = \frac{2}{3}k + 5.
   \]
   Thus, the intersection point is \((k, \frac{2}{3}k + 5)\).

3. **Determine the area of the triangle**:
   The base of the triangle is the horizontal distance from \((-7.5, 0)\) to \((k, 0)\), which is \(|k + 7.5|\). The height of the triangle is the vertical distance from the \(x\)-axis to the point \((k, \frac{2}{3}k + 5)\), which is \(\frac{2}{3}k + 5\).

   The area \(A\) of the triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times |k + 7.5| \times \left(\frac{2}{3}k + 5\right).
   \]

4. **Set up the inequality for the area**:
   We want the area to be less than 20:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} |k + 7.5| \left(\frac{2}{3}k + 5\right) < 20.
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 2:
   \[
   |k + 7.5| \left(\frac{2}{3}k + 5\right) < 40.
   \]

5. **Consider cases for \(k + 7.5\)**:
   - **Case 1**: \(k + 7.5 \geq 0\) (i.e., \(k \geq -7.5\)):
     \[
     (k + 7.5) \left(\frac{2}{3}k + 5\right) < 40.
     \]
     Expanding this:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3}k^2 + 5k + 5 \cdot 7.5 < 40 \implies \frac{2}{3}k^2 + 5k + 37.5 < 40 \implies \frac{2}{3}k^2 + 5k - 2.5 < 0.
     \]
     Multiplying through by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     2k^2 + 15k - 7.5 < 0.
     \]
     Solving the quadratic equation \(2k^2 + 15k - 7.5 = 0\) using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     k = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{15^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-7.5)}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{225 + 60}}{4} = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{285}}{4}.
     \]
     Approximating \(\sqrt{285} \approx 16.88\):
     \[
     k \approx \frac{-15 \pm 16.88}{4} \implies k_1 \approx \frac{1.88}{4} \approx 0.47, \quad k_2 \approx \frac{-31.88}{4} \approx -7.97.
     \]
     Thus, the roots are approximately \(k \approx 0.47\) and \(k \approx -7.97\).

   - **Case 2**: \(k + 7.5 < 0\

Problem: Lana defines a function $f(x)$ which is given by the formula $$f(x) = x^2,$$ but only on a domain she has specified which consists of finitely many values $x$; she leaves the function undefined for all other $x$.

Given that the range of $f(x)$ is $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$, what is the maximum number of points that could be in its domain?
Model Response: To determine the maximum number of points that could be in the domain of the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) such that the range is \( \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\} \), we need to find the values of \( x \) that yield these outputs.

The function \( f(x) = x^2 \) produces non-negative outputs. We can find the values of \( x \) that correspond to each output in the specified range:

- For \( f(x) = 0 \): \( x = 0 \)
- For \( f(x) = 1 \): \( x = 1 \) or \( x = -1 \)
- For \( f(x) = 2 \): \( x = \sqrt{2} \) or \( x = -\sqrt{2} \)
- For \( f(x) = 3 \): \( x = \sqrt{3} \) or \( x = -\sqrt{3} \)
- For \( f(x) = 4 \): \( x = 2 \) or \( x = -2 \)
- For \( f(x) = 5 \): \( x = \sqrt{5} \) or \( x = -\sqrt{5} \)
- For \( f(x) = 6 \): \( x = \sqrt{6} \) or \( x = -\sqrt{6} \)
- For \( f(x) = 7 \): \( x = \sqrt{7} \) or \( x = -\sqrt{7} \)
- For \( f(x) = 8 \): \( x = \sqrt{8} \) or \( x = -\sqrt{8} \)
- For \( f(x) = 9 \): \( x = 3 \) or \( x = -3 \)

Now, we count the distinct values of \( x \) that can be included in the domain:

- From \( f(x) = 0 \): 1 value (0)
- From \( f(x) = 1 \): 2 values (1, -1)
- From \( f(x) = 2 \): 2 values (\(\sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2}\))
- From \( f(x) = 3 \): 2 values (\(\sqrt{3}, -\sqrt{3}\))
- From \( f(x) = 4 \): 2 values (2, -2)
- From \( f(x) = 5 \): 2 values (\(\sqrt{5}, -\sqrt{5}\))
- From \( f(x) = 6 \): 2 values (\(\sqrt{6}, -\sqrt{6}\))
- From \( f(x) = 7 \): 2 values (\(\sqrt{7}, -\sqrt{7}\))
- From \( f(x) = 8 \): 2 values (\(\sqrt{8}, -\sqrt{8}\))
- From \( f(x) = 9 \): 2 values (3, -3)

Now, we sum these values:

\[
1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 1 + 18 = 19
\]

Thus, the maximum number of points that could be in the domain of \( f(x) \) is \( 19 \).

Problem: If $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive integers such that $6xyz+30xy+21xz+2yz+105x+10y+7z=812$, find $x+y+z$.
Model Response: To solve the equation \(6xyz + 30xy + 21xz + 2yz + 105x + 10y + 7z = 812\), we will first rearrange it to isolate the terms involving \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).

We can rewrite the equation as:

\[
6xyz + 30xy + 21xz + 2yz + 105x + 10y + 7z - 812 = 0.
\]

This is a polynomial in three variables \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). To find integer solutions, we can try substituting small integer values for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) and see if we can find a combination that satisfies the equation.

Let's start by testing small values for \(x\):

1. **Let \(x = 1\)**:
   \[
   6(1)yz + 30(1)y + 21(1)z + 2yz + 105(1) + 10y + 7z = 812.
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   6yz + 30y + 21z + 2yz + 105 + 10y + 7z = 812.
   \]
   Combining like terms:
   \[
   (6 + 2)yz + (30 + 10)y + (21 + 7)z + 105 = 812,
   \]
   which simplifies to:
   \[
   8yz + 40y + 28z + 105 = 812.
   \]
   Subtracting 105 from both sides:
   \[
   8yz + 40y + 28z = 707.
   \]

2. **Let \(y = 1\)**:
   \[
   8(1)z + 40(1) + 28z = 707.
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   8z + 40 + 28z = 707,
   \]
   or:
   \[
   36z + 40 = 707.
   \]
   Subtracting 40 from both sides:
   \[
   36z = 667 \implies z = \frac{667}{36} \text{ (not an integer)}.
   \]

3. **Let \(y = 2\)**:
   \[
   8(2)z + 40(2) + 28z = 707.
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   16z + 80 + 28z = 707,
   \]
   or:
   \[
   44z + 80 = 707.
   \]
   Subtracting 80 from both sides:
   \[
   44z = 627 \implies z = \frac{627}{44} \text{ (not an integer)}.
   \]

4. **Let \(y = 3\)**:
   \[
   8(3)z + 40(3) + 28z = 707.
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   24z + 120 + 28z = 707,
   \]
   or:
   \[
   52z + 120 = 707.
   \]
   Subtracting 120 from both sides:
   \[
   52z = 587 \implies z = \frac{587}{52} \text{ (not an integer)}.
   \]

Continuing this process, we can try different values for \(x\) and \(y\) until we find integer solutions.

After testing various combinations, we find:

- **Let \(x = 3\), \(y = 5\), \(z = 7\)**:
   \[
   6(3)(5)(7) + 30(3)(5) + 21(3)(7) + 2(5)(7) + 105(3) + 10(5) + 7(7) = 812.
   \]
   Calculating each term:
   - \(6(3)(5)(7) = 630\)
   - \(30(3)(5) = 450\)
   - \(21(3)(7) = 441\)
   - \(2(5)(7) = 70\)
   - \(105(3) = 315\)
   - \(10(5) = 50\)
   - \(7(7) = 49\)

Problem: The polynomial $p(x) = x^2+ax+b$ has distinct roots $2a$ and $b$. Find $a+b$.
Model Response: To find \( a + b \) given that the polynomial \( p(x) = x^2 + ax + b \) has distinct roots \( 2a \) and \( b \), we can use Vieta's formulas. According to Vieta's formulas, for a quadratic polynomial \( x^2 + px + q \) with roots \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \):

1. The sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 = -p \).
2. The product of the roots \( r_1 r_2 = q \).

In our case, the roots are \( 2a \) and \( b \). Therefore, we have:

1. \( 2a + b = -a \)
2. \( (2a)(b) = b \)

From the second equation, since \( b \neq 0 \) (as the roots are distinct), we can divide both sides by \( b \):

\[
2a = 1 \implies a = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Now substituting \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) into the first equation:

\[
2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + b = -\frac{1}{2}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
1 + b = -\frac{1}{2}
\]

Solving for \( b \):

\[
b = -\frac{1}{2} - 1 = -\frac{3}{2}
\]

Now we can find \( a + b \):

\[
a + b = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{3}{2} = -1
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{-1}

Problem: A ball is dropped straight down from a height of 16 feet. If it bounces back each time to a height one-half the height from which it last fell, how far will the ball have traveled when it hits the floor for the sixth time, in feet?
Model Response: To find the total distance traveled by the ball when it hits the floor for the sixth time, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Initial Drop**: The ball is dropped from a height of 16 feet. This is the first distance traveled.
2. **Bounces**: After hitting the ground, the ball bounces back to half the height from which it fell. Therefore, the heights of the bounces will be:
   - First bounce: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) feet
   - Second bounce: \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) feet
   - Third bounce: \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) feet
   - Fourth bounce: \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) foot

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The ball travels down 16 feet initially.
   - It then travels up 8 feet and down 8 feet for the first bounce.
   - It travels up 4 feet and down 4 feet for the second bounce.
   - It travels up 2 feet and down 2 feet for the third bounce.
   - It travels up 1 foot and down 1 foot for the fourth bounce.

Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled:

- Distance for the initial drop: \( 16 \) feet
- Distance for the first bounce: \( 8 + 8 = 16 \) feet
- Distance for the second bounce: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \) feet
- Distance for the third bounce: \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) feet
- Distance for the fourth bounce: \( 1 + 1 = 2 \) feet

Adding these distances together gives:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 16 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 46 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the total distance traveled by the ball when it hits the floor for the sixth time is \(\boxed{46}\) feet.

Problem: The quadratic $3x^2-24x+72$ can be written in the form $a(x+b)^2+c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. What is $a+b+c$?
Model Response: To rewrite the quadratic \(3x^2 - 24x + 72\) in the form \(a(x+b)^2+c\), we start by factoring out the coefficient of \(x^2\) from the first two terms:

\[
3(x^2 - 8x) + 72.
\]

Next, we complete the square for the expression inside the parentheses. To do this, we take the coefficient of \(x\) (which is \(-8\)), divide it by \(2\) to get \(-4\), and then square it to obtain \(16\). We can then rewrite the expression as follows:

\[
3(x^2 - 8x + 16 - 16) + 72 = 3((x - 4)^2 - 16) + 72.
\]

Distributing the \(3\) gives:

\[
3(x - 4)^2 - 48 + 72 = 3(x - 4)^2 + 24.
\]

Now we have the quadratic in the desired form:

\[
3(x - 4)^2 + 24.
\]

From this, we can identify \(a = 3\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = 24\). 

Now, we calculate \(a + b + c\):

\[
a + b + c = 3 - 4 + 24 = 23.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{23}.

Problem: Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are nonzero real numbers, and that the equation  $${x^2 + ax + b = 0}$$ has solutions $a$ and $b$. Then what is the pair $(a,b)$?
Model Response: To solve the problem, we start with the quadratic equation given by:

\[
x^2 + ax + b = 0
\]

We know that the solutions (roots) of this equation are \(a\) and \(b\). By Vieta's formulas, we have:

1. The sum of the roots \(a + b = -a\)
2. The product of the roots \(ab = b\)

From the first equation, we can rearrange it to find:

\[
a + b + a = 0 \implies 2a + b = 0 \implies b = -2a
\]

Now substituting \(b = -2a\) into the second equation \(ab = b\):

\[
a(-2a) = -2a
\]

Assuming \(b \neq 0\) (since \(b\) is nonzero), we can divide both sides by \(b\):

\[
-2a = 1 \implies a = -\frac{1}{2}
\]

Now substituting \(a = -\frac{1}{2}\) back into the equation for \(b\):

\[
b = -2(-\frac{1}{2}) = 1
\]

Thus, we find the pair \((a, b)\):

\[
(a, b) = \left(-\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)
\]

Finally, we express the answer in the required format:

\[
\boxed{\left(-\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)}

Problem: The $n^{\text{th}}$ term of a certain geometric series is given by $a\cdot r^{n-1}$, where $a$ and $r$ are positive integers and $r$ is greater than 1. Bill picks out $k$ different numbers in this sequence, all of which have the same number of digits. What is the largest possible value of $k$?
Model Response: To find the largest possible value of \( k \) such that Bill can pick \( k \) different numbers from the geometric series \( a \cdot r^{n-1} \) with the same number of digits, we need to analyze the conditions under which the terms of the series have the same number of digits.

The number of digits \( d \) of a number \( x \) can be determined using the formula:
\[
d = \lfloor \log_{10} x \rfloor + 1
\]
For the \( n^{\text{th}} \) term of the geometric series, we have:
\[
x_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}
\]
The number of digits in \( x_n \) is:
\[
d_n = \lfloor \log_{10} (a \cdot r^{n-1}) \rfloor + 1 = \lfloor \log_{10} a + (n-1) \log_{10} r \rfloor + 1
\]

For \( k \) different terms \( x_{n_1}, x_{n_2}, \ldots, x_{n_k} \) to have the same number of digits, we need:
\[
\lfloor \log_{10} a + (n_1 - 1) \log_{10} r \rfloor = \lfloor \log_{10} a + (n_2 - 1) \log_{10} r \rfloor = \ldots = \lfloor \log_{10} a + (n_k - 1) \log_{10} r \rfloor
\]

This implies that the fractional parts of \( \log_{10} a + (n_i - 1) \log_{10} r \) must fall within the same integer range. 

Let:
\[
x = \log_{10} a \quad \text{and} \quad y = \log_{10} r
\]
Then we can express the condition as:
\[
\lfloor x + (n_i - 1)y \rfloor = m \quad \text{for some integer } m
\]
This means:
\[
m \leq x + (n_i - 1)y < m + 1
\]
Rearranging gives:
\[
m - x < (n_i - 1)y < m + 1 - x
\]
Dividing by \( y \) (since \( y > 0 \)):
\[
\frac{m - x}{y} < n_i - 1 < \frac{m + 1 - x}{y}
\]
Thus:
\[
\frac{m - x}{y} + 1 < n_i < \frac{m + 1 - x}{y} + 1
\]
This means that \( n_i \) must lie within a specific interval:
\[
\left( \frac{m - x}{y} + 1, \frac{m + 1 - x}{y} + 1 \right)
\]
The length of this interval is:
\[
\frac{(m + 1 - x) - (m - x)}{y} = \frac{1}{y}
\]
This indicates that the maximum number of integers \( n_i \) that can fit in this interval is:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{1}{y} \right\rfloor
\]

Since \( y = \log_{10} r \), we have:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{1}{\log_{10} r} \right\rfloor
\]

To maximize \( k \), we need to minimize \( \log_{10} r \). The smallest integer \( r \) can be is \( 2 \) (since \( r \) must be greater than 1). Thus:
\[
\log_{10} 2 \approx 0.301
\]
Calculating \( k \):
\[
k \leq \left\lfloor \frac{1}{0.301} \right\rfloor \approx \left\lfloor 3.32 \right\rfloor = 3
\]

Thus, the largest possible value of \( k \) is:
\[
\boxed{3}

Problem: If $a+b=7$ and $a^3+b^3=42$, what is the value of the sum $\dfrac{1}{a}+\dfrac{1}{b}$?  Express your answer as a common fraction.
Model Response: To find the value of \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}\), we can use the identity:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{a+b}{ab}
\]

We know from the problem that \(a + b = 7\). 

Next, we need to find \(ab\). We can use the identity for the sum of cubes:

\[
a^3 + b^3 = (a+b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)
\]

We can express \(a^2 + b^2\) in terms of \(a + b\) and \(ab\):

\[
a^2 + b^2 = (a+b)^2 - 2ab = 7^2 - 2ab = 49 - 2ab
\]

Substituting this into the sum of cubes formula gives:

\[
a^3 + b^3 = (a+b)((a^2 + b^2) - ab) = (7)((49 - 2ab) - ab) = 7(49 - 3ab)
\]

We know \(a^3 + b^3 = 42\), so we set up the equation:

\[
7(49 - 3ab) = 42
\]

Dividing both sides by 7:

\[
49 - 3ab = 6
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
3ab = 49 - 6 = 43 \implies ab = \frac{43}{3}
\]

Now we can substitute \(a + b\) and \(ab\) back into the expression for \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}\):

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{a+b}{ab} = \frac{7}{\frac{43}{3}} = 7 \cdot \frac{3}{43} = \frac{21}{43}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

Problem: Let $p(x)=\sqrt{-x}$, and $q(x)=8x^2+10x-3$. The domain of $p(q(x))$ can be written in the form $a\le x \le b$. Find $b-a$.
Model Response: To find the domain of \( p(q(x)) \), we first need to determine the conditions under which \( p(x) = \sqrt{-x} \) is defined. The function \( p(x) \) is defined when its argument is non-negative, i.e., 

\[
-q(x) \geq 0 \implies q(x) \leq 0.
\]

Next, we need to analyze the quadratic function \( q(x) = 8x^2 + 10x - 3 \). To find the values of \( x \) for which \( q(x) \leq 0 \), we first find the roots of the equation \( q(x) = 0 \).

Using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},
\]

where \( a = 8 \), \( b = 10 \), and \( c = -3 \):

\[
x = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{10^2 - 4 \cdot 8 \cdot (-3)}}{2 \cdot 8} = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{100 + 96}}{16} = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{196}}{16} = \frac{-10 \pm 14}{16}.
\]

Calculating the two roots:

1. \( x_1 = \frac{-10 + 14}{16} = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4} \)
2. \( x_2 = \frac{-10 - 14}{16} = \frac{-24}{16} = -\frac{3}{2} \)

The roots of \( q(x) \) are \( x = \frac{1}{4} \) and \( x = -\frac{3}{2} \). Since the parabola opens upwards (as the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive), \( q(x) \leq 0 \) between the roots:

\[
-\frac{3}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Thus, the domain of \( p(q(x)) \) is:

\[
-\frac{3}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{1}{4}.
\]

To find \( b - a \), where \( a = -\frac{3}{2} \) and \( b = \frac{1}{4} \):

\[
b - a = \frac{1}{4} - \left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{6}{4} = \frac{7}{4}.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

Model Response: To rewrite the expression \(-2x^2 - 20x - 53\) in the form \(a(x+d)^2 + e\), we first factor out \(-2\) from the quadratic terms:

\[
-2(x^2 + 10x) - 53.
\]

Next, we complete the square for the expression inside the parentheses. To do this, we take half of the coefficient of \(x\) (which is \(10\)), square it, and add and subtract that square inside the parentheses:

\[
-2\left(x^2 + 10x + 25 - 25\right) - 53 = -2\left((x + 5)^2 - 25\right) - 53.
\]

Now, we can distribute the \(-2\):

\[
-2(x + 5)^2 + 50 - 53 = -2(x + 5)^2 - 3.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
a = -2, \quad d = 5, \quad e = -3.

Now, we find the sum \(a + d + e\):

\[
-2 + 5 - 3 = 0.

Problem: Sue can either borrow $10,\!000$ dollars for $5$ years with a simple interest of $7\%$ annually or an interest which compounds annually for $6\%$. How much more money, rounded to the nearest dollar, would she have to pay back for the more expensive interest than the less expensive interest?
Model Response: To find out how much more money Sue would have to pay back for the more expensive interest than the less expensive interest, we first calculate the total amount she would pay back for both options.

**1. Simple Interest Calculation:**

The formula for simple interest is given by:

\[
A = P(1 + rt)
\]

where:
- \( A \) is the total amount to be paid back,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial loan),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),
- \( t \) is the time in years.

For the simple interest option:
- \( P = 10,000 \)
- \( r = 0.07 \)
- \( t = 5 \)

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
A = 10000(1 + 0.07 \cdot 5) = 10000(1 + 0.35) = 10000 \cdot 1.35 = 13500
\]

**2. Compound Interest Calculation:**

The formula for compound interest is given by:

\[
A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
\]

where:
- \( n \) is the number of times interest is compounded per year.

For the compound interest option:
- \( P = 10,000 \)
- \( r = 0.06 \)
- \( n = 1 \) (compounded annually)
- \( t = 5 \)

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
A = 10000\left(1 + \frac{0.06}{1}\right)^{1 \cdot 5} = 10000(1 + 0.06)^{5} = 10000(1.06)^{5}
\]

Calculating \( (1.06)^{5} \):

\[
(1.06)^{5} \approx 1.338225
\]

Now substituting back into the formula:

\[
A \approx 10000 \cdot 1.338225 \approx 13382.25
\]

**3. Finding the Difference:**

Now we find the difference between the two amounts:

\[
\text{Difference} = 13500 - 13382.25 \approx 117.75
\]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the difference is:

\[
\text{Difference} \approx 118
\]

Thus, the final answer, enclosed in LaTeX \(\boxed{}\) notation, is:

\[
\boxed{118}

Problem: Suppose $x$ is a solution to $x^2 + 1 = 7x$. What is the sum of $x$ and its reciprocal?
Model Response: To solve the equation \(x^2 + 1 = 7x\), we first rearrange it into standard quadratic form:

\[
x^2 - 7x + 1 = 0.
\]

Next, we can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},
\]

where \(a = 1\), \(b = -7\), and \(c = 1\). Plugging in these values gives:

\[
x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 - 4}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{45}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm 3\sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Thus, the two solutions for \(x\) are:

\[
x_1 = \frac{7 + 3\sqrt{5}}{2}, \quad x_2 = \frac{7 - 3\sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Next, we need to find the sum of \(x\) and its reciprocal, which can be expressed as:

\[
x + \frac{1}{x}.
\]

To compute this, we can use the identity:

\[
x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{x^2 + 1}{x}.
\]

Since we already have \(x^2 + 1 = 7x\) from the original equation, we can substitute this into our expression:

\[
x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7x}{x} = 7.
\]

Thus, the sum of \(x\) and its reciprocal is:

\[
\boxed{7}.

Model Response: To express the quadratic \(3x^2 + x - 4\) in the form \(a(x - h)^2 + k\), we will complete the square.

1. Start with the quadratic:
   \[
   3x^2 + x - 4
   \]

2. Factor out the coefficient of \(x^2\) from the first two terms:
   \[
   3\left(x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x\right) - 4
   \]

3. To complete the square, take half of the coefficient of \(x\) (which is \(\frac{1}{3}\)), square it, and add and subtract it inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \text{Half of } \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6}, \quad \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{36}
   \]
   Thus, we rewrite the expression:
   \[
   3\left(x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{36} - \frac{1}{36}\right) - 4
   \]

4. This simplifies to:
   \[
   3\left(\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{36}\right) - 4
   \]

5. Distributing the \(3\):
   \[
   3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{3}{36} - 4 = 3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{12} - 4
   \]

6. Convert \(-4\) to a fraction with a denominator of \(12\):
   \[
   -4 = -\frac{48}{12}
   \]

7. Combine the constants:
   \[
   3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{12} - \frac{48}{12} = 3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{49}{12}
   \]

Now, we have the expression in the form \(a(x - h)^2 + k\):
\[
a = 3, \quad h = -\frac{1}{6}, \quad k = -\frac{49}{12}
\]

Thus, the value of \(k\) is:

Problem: A triangle is formed with edges along the line $y=\frac{2}{3}x+5$, the $x$-axis, and the line $x=k$. If the area of the triangle is less than $20$, find the sum of all possible integral values of $k$.
Model Response: To find the area of the triangle formed by the line \( y = \frac{2}{3}x + 5 \), the \( x \)-axis, and the line \( x = k \), we first need to determine the points where the line intersects the \( x \)-axis and the vertical line \( x = k \).

1. **Finding the intersection with the \( x \)-axis:**
   The intersection occurs when \( y = 0 \):
   \[
   0 = \frac{2}{3}x + 5 \implies \frac{2}{3}x = -5 \implies x = -\frac{15}{2} = -7.5.
   \]
   Thus, the point of intersection with the \( x \)-axis is \( \left(-\frac{15}{2}, 0\right) \).

2. **Finding the intersection with the line \( x = k \):**
   Substituting \( x = k \) into the line equation gives:
   \[
   y = \frac{2}{3}k + 5.
   \]
   Therefore, the point of intersection is \( (k, \frac{2}{3}k + 5) \).

3. **Calculating the area of the triangle:**
   The base of the triangle is the horizontal distance from \( k \) to \( -\frac{15}{2} \):
   \[
   \text{Base} = k - \left(-\frac{15}{2}\right) = k + \frac{15}{2}.
   \]
   The height of the triangle is the \( y \)-coordinate of the intersection point with the line \( x = k \):
   \[
   \text{Height} = \frac{2}{3}k + 5.
   \]
   The area \( A \) of the triangle is given by:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height} = \frac{1}{2} \left(k + \frac{15}{2}\right) \left(\frac{2}{3}k + 5\right).
   \]

4. **Setting up the inequality:**
   We want the area to be less than 20:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left(k + \frac{15}{2}\right) \left(\frac{2}{3}k + 5\right) < 20.
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 2:
   \[
   \left(k + \frac{15}{2}\right) \left(\frac{2}{3}k + 5\right) < 40.
   \]

5. **Expanding the left-hand side:**
   \[
   k \cdot \frac{2}{3}k + 5k + \frac{15}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3}k + \frac{15}{2} \cdot 5 < 40.
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}k^2 + 5k + 5k + \frac{15}{3} < 40,
   \]
   or:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}k^2 + 10k + 5 < 40.
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}k^2 + 10k - 35 < 0.
   \]
   Multiplying through by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   2k^2 + 30k - 105 < 0.
   \]

6. **Finding the roots of the quadratic:**
   Using the quadratic formula:
   \[
   k = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-30 \pm \sqrt{30^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-105)}}{2 \cdot 2}.
   \]
   Calculating the discriminant:
   \[
   30^2 + 840 = 900.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   k = \frac{-30 \pm 30}{4} = \frac{0}{4} = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad k = \frac{-60}{4} = -15.
   \]

7. **Finding the intervals:**
   The roots are \( k = -15 \) and \( k = 0 \). The quadratic opens upwards (since the coefficient of \( k^2 \) is positive), so the inequality \( 2k^2 + 30k - 105 < 0 \) holds between the roots:
   \[
   -15 < k < 0.
   \]

8. **Finding the integer values of \( k \):**

Problem: Lana defines a function $f(x)$ which is given by the formula $$f(x) = x^2,$$ but only on a domain she has specified which consists of finitely many values $x$; she leaves the function undefined for all other $x$.

Given that the range of $f(x)$ is $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$, what is the maximum number of points that could be in its domain?
Model Response: To determine the maximum number of points in the domain of the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) such that the range is limited to \( \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\} \), we need to find the values of \( x \) that yield these outputs.

The outputs of \( f(x) = x^2 \) for real numbers \( x \) are non-negative. Therefore, we can find the corresponding \( x \) values for each output in the specified range:

1. \( f(x) = 0 \) gives \( x = 0 \)
2. \( f(x) = 1 \) gives \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -1 \)
3. \( f(x) = 2 \) gives \( x = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \)
4. \( f(x) = 3 \) gives \( x = \sqrt{3} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{3} \)
5. \( f(x) = 4 \) gives \( x = 2 \) and \( x = -2 \)
6. \( f(x) = 5 \) gives \( x = \sqrt{5} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{5} \)
7. \( f(x) = 6 \) gives \( x = \sqrt{6} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{6} \)
8. \( f(x) = 7 \) gives \( x = \sqrt{7} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{7} \)
9. \( f(x) = 8 \) gives \( x = \sqrt{8} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{8} \)
10. \( f(x) = 9 \) gives \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -3 \)

Now, we count the unique \( x \) values that correspond to each output:

- For \( 0 \): 1 point (\( 0 \))
- For \( 1 \): 2 points (\( 1, -1 \))
- For \( 2 \): 2 points (\( \sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2} \))
- For \( 3 \): 2 points (\( \sqrt{3}, -\sqrt{3} \))
- For \( 4 \): 2 points (\( 2, -2 \))
- For \( 5 \): 2 points (\( \sqrt{5}, -\sqrt{5} \))
- For \( 6 \): 2 points (\( \sqrt{6}, -\sqrt{6} \))
- For \( 7 \): 2 points (\( \sqrt{7}, -\sqrt{7} \))
- For \( 8 \): 2 points (\( \sqrt{8}, -\sqrt{8} \))
- For \( 9 \): 2 points (\( 3, -3 \))

Now, we sum these points:

\[
1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 1 + 18 = 19
\]

Thus, the maximum number of points that could be in the domain of \( f(x) \) while keeping the range within \( \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\} \) is \( 19 \).

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{19}

Problem: If $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive integers such that $6xyz+30xy+21xz+2yz+105x+10y+7z=812$, find $x+y+z$.
Model Response: To solve the equation 

\[
6xyz + 30xy + 21xz + 2yz + 105x + 10y + 7z = 812,
\]

we can start by rearranging it to isolate the terms involving \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). 

First, we can factor the left-hand side by grouping terms. Notice that we can factor out common terms:

1. Group \(6xyz\), \(30xy\), and \(21xz\):
   \[
   6xy(z + 5) + 21xz + 2yz + 105x + 10y + 7z = 812.
   \]

2. Next, we can try substituting small integer values for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) to see if we can find a solution that satisfies the equation.

Let's try \(x = 1\):

\[
6(1)yz + 30(1)y + 21(1)z + 2yz + 105(1) + 10y + 7z = 812.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
6yz + 30y + 21z + 2yz + 105 + 10y + 7z = 812.
\]

Combining like terms gives:

\[
(6 + 2)yz + (30 + 10)y + (21 + 7)z + 105 = 812,
\]
\[
8yz + 40y + 28z + 105 = 812.
\]

Subtracting 105 from both sides:

\[
8yz + 40y + 28z = 707.
\]

Now, let's try \(y = 1\):

\[
8(1)z + 40(1) + 28z = 707,
\]
\[
8z + 40 + 28z = 707,
\]
\[
36z + 40 = 707.
\]

Subtracting 40 from both sides:

\[
36z = 667.
\]

Dividing by 36 gives:

\[
z = \frac{667}{36} \approx 18.52,
\]

which is not an integer. 

Next, let's try \(x = 2\):

\[
6(2)yz + 30(2)y + 21(2)z + 2yz + 105(2) + 10y + 7z = 812,
\]
\[
12yz + 60y + 42z + 2yz + 210 + 10y + 7z = 812.
\]

Combining like terms gives:

\[
(12 + 2)yz + (60 + 10)y + (42 + 7)z + 210 = 812,
\]
\[
14yz + 70y + 49z + 210 = 812.
\]

Subtracting 210 from both sides:

\[
14yz + 70y + 49z = 602.
\]

Now, let's try \(y = 2\):

\[
14(2)z + 70(2) + 49z = 602,
\]
\[
28z + 140 + 49z = 602,
\]
\[
77z + 140 = 602.
\]

Subtracting 140 from both sides:

\[
77z = 462.
\]

Dividing by 77 gives:

\[
z = 6.
\]

Now we have \(x = 2\), \(y = 2\), and \(z = 6\). 

Finally, we calculate \(x + y + z\):

\[
x + y + z = 2 + 2 + 6 = 10.
\]

Thus, the final answer is 

\[
\boxed{10}.

Problem: The polynomial $p(x) = x^2+ax+b$ has distinct roots $2a$ and $b$. Find $a+b$.
Model Response: To find \( a + b \) given that the polynomial \( p(x) = x^2 + ax + b \) has distinct roots \( 2a \) and \( b \), we can use Vieta's formulas.

According to Vieta's formulas, for a quadratic polynomial \( x^2 + px + q \):
- The sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 = -p \)
- The product of the roots \( r_1 \cdot r_2 = q \)

In our case, the roots are \( 2a \) and \( b \). Therefore, we have:
1. \( 2a + b = -a \) (sum of the roots)
2. \( 2a \cdot b = b \) (product of the roots)

From the second equation, we can factor out \( b \):
\[
2ab = b
\]
If \( b \neq 0 \), we can divide both sides by \( b \):
\[
2a = 1 \implies a = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Now substituting \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) into the first equation:
\[
2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + b = -\frac{1}{2}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
1 + b = -\frac{1}{2}
\]
Solving for \( b \):
\[
b = -\frac{1}{2} - 1 = -\frac{3}{2}
\]

Now we can find \( a + b \):
\[
a + b = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{3}{2} = -1
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{-1}

Problem: A ball is dropped straight down from a height of 16 feet. If it bounces back each time to a height one-half the height from which it last fell, how far will the ball have traveled when it hits the floor for the sixth time, in feet?
Model Response: To find the total distance traveled by the ball when it hits the floor for the sixth time, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Initial Drop**: The ball is dropped from a height of 16 feet. This is the first fall.
2. **Bounces**: After hitting the ground, the ball bounces back to half the height from which it fell. Therefore, after the first fall, it bounces back to \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) feet.
3. **Subsequent Falls and Bounces**:
   - After the first bounce, it falls again from 8 feet.
   - It then bounces back to \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) feet.
   - It falls from 4 feet.
   - It bounces back to \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) feet.
   - It falls from 2 feet.
   - It bounces back to \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) foot.
   - It falls from 1 foot.

Now, we can summarize the distances traveled:

- **First fall**: 16 feet (to the ground)
- **First bounce up**: 8 feet
- **Second fall**: 8 feet (to the ground)
- **Second bounce up**: 4 feet
- **Third fall**: 4 feet (to the ground)
- **Third bounce up**: 2 feet
- **Fourth fall**: 2 feet (to the ground)
- **Fourth bounce up**: 1 foot
- **Fifth fall**: 1 foot (to the ground)

Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{First fall} + \text{First bounce} + \text{Second fall} + \text{Second bounce} + \text{Third fall} + \text{Third bounce} + \text{Fourth fall} + \text{Fourth bounce} + \text{Fifth fall}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 16 + 8 + 8 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

- \( 16 + 8 = 24 \)
- \( 24 + 8 = 32 \)
- \( 32 + 4 = 36 \)
- \( 36 + 4 = 40 \)
- \( 40 + 2 = 42 \)
- \( 42 + 2 = 44 \)
- \( 44 + 1 = 45 \)
- \( 45 + 1 = 46 \)

Thus, the total distance traveled by the ball when it hits the floor for the sixth time is:

\[
\boxed{46}

Problem: The quadratic $3x^2-24x+72$ can be written in the form $a(x+b)^2+c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. What is $a+b+c$?
Model Response: To rewrite the quadratic \(3x^2 - 24x + 72\) in the form \(a(x+b)^2+c\), we first factor out the coefficient of \(x^2\) from the first two terms:

\[
3(x^2 - 8x) + 72.
\]

Next, we complete the square for the expression inside the parentheses. To do this, we take the coefficient of \(x\) (which is \(-8\)), divide it by \(2\) to get \(-4\), and then square it to get \(16\). We add and subtract \(16\) inside the parentheses:

\[
3(x^2 - 8x + 16 - 16) + 72 = 3((x - 4)^2 - 16) + 72.
\]

Now, we distribute the \(3\):

\[
3(x - 4)^2 - 48 + 72 = 3(x - 4)^2 + 24.
\]

Thus, we have expressed the quadratic in the desired form:

\[
a = 3, \quad b = -4, \quad c = 24.
\]

Now, we calculate \(a + b + c\):

\[
a + b + c = 3 - 4 + 24 = 23.

Problem: Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are nonzero real numbers, and that the equation  $${x^2 + ax + b = 0}$$ has solutions $a$ and $b$. Then what is the pair $(a,b)$?
Model Response: The given conditions imply that the quadratic equation can be expressed as:

\[
x^2 + ax + b = (x - a)(x - b) = x^2 - (a + b)x + ab.
\]

From this, we can equate coefficients:

1. \( a + b = -a \)
2. \( ab = b \)

From the second equation, since \( b \neq 0 \), we can divide both sides by \( b \):

\[
a = 1.
\]

Substituting \( a = 1 \) into the first equation gives:

\[
1 + b = -1 \implies b = -2.

Problem: The $n^{\text{th}}$ term of a certain geometric series is given by $a\cdot r^{n-1}$, where $a$ and $r$ are positive integers and $r$ is greater than 1. Bill picks out $k$ different numbers in this sequence, all of which have the same number of digits. What is the largest possible value of $k$?
Model Response: To find the largest possible value of \( k \) such that Bill can pick \( k \) different numbers from the geometric series \( a \cdot r^{n-1} \) with the same number of digits, we need to analyze the conditions under which the numbers in the series have the same number of digits.

The number of digits \( d \) of a number \( x \) can be determined using the formula:
\[
d = \lfloor \log_{10} x \rfloor + 1
\]
For the terms in the geometric series, we have:
\[
x_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}
\]
The number of digits in \( x_n \) is:
\[
d_n = \lfloor \log_{10} (a \cdot r^{n-1}) \rfloor + 1 = \lfloor \log_{10} a + (n-1) \log_{10} r \rfloor + 1
\]

For \( k \) different terms \( x_{n_1}, x_{n_2}, \ldots, x_{n_k} \) to have the same number of digits, we need:
\[
\lfloor \log_{10} a + (n_1 - 1) \log_{10} r \rfloor = \lfloor \log_{10} a + (n_2 - 1) \log_{10} r \rfloor = \ldots = \lfloor \log_{10} a + (n_k - 1) \log_{10} r \rfloor
\]

This means that the fractional parts of \( \log_{10} a + (n_i - 1) \log_{10} r \) must fall within the same integer range. Specifically, we can express this condition as:
\[
\log_{10} a + (n_i - 1) \log_{10} r \in [m, m+1) \quad \text{for some integer } m
\]
for all \( i = 1, 2, \ldots, k \).

Rearranging gives:
\[
m - \log_{10} a \leq (n_i - 1) \log_{10} r < m + 1 - \log_{10} a
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
\frac{m - \log_{10} a}{\log_{10} r} + 1 \leq n_i < \frac{m + 1 - \log_{10} a}{\log_{10} r} + 1
\]

The width of the interval for \( n_i \) is:
\[
\left( \frac{m + 1 - \log_{10} a}{\log_{10} r} + 1 \right) - \left( \frac{m - \log_{10} a}{\log_{10} r} + 1 \right) = \frac{1}{\log_{10} r}
\]

Thus, the number of integers \( n_i \) that can fit in this interval is:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{1}{\log_{10} r} \right\rfloor
\]

Since \( r \) is a positive integer greater than 1, \( \log_{10} r \) is positive, and as \( r \) increases, \( \log_{10} r \) increases, causing \( \frac{1}{\log_{10} r} \) to decrease.

To maximize \( k \), we should minimize \( r \). The smallest integer \( r \) greater than 1 is 2. Thus:
\[
\log_{10} 2 \approx 0.301
\]
Calculating \( \frac{1}{\log_{10} 2} \):
\[
\frac{1}{\log_{10} 2} \approx \frac{1}{0.301} \approx 3.32
\]
Thus, the maximum integer \( k \) is:
\[
\lfloor 3.32 \rfloor = 3
\]

Therefore, the largest possible value of \( k \) is:
\[
\boxed{3}

Problem: If $a+b=7$ and $a^3+b^3=42$, what is the value of the sum $\dfrac{1}{a}+\dfrac{1}{b}$?  Express your answer as a common fraction.
Model Response: To find the value of \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}\), we can start by using the identity for the sum of cubes:

\[
a^3 + b^3 = (a+b)(a^2 - ab + b^2).
\]

Given that \(a + b = 7\) and \(a^3 + b^3 = 42\), we can substitute these values into the equation:

\[
42 = 7(a^2 - ab + b^2).
\]

Dividing both sides by 7 gives:

\[
a^2 - ab + b^2 = 6.
\]

Next, we can use the square of the sum of \(a\) and \(b\):

\[
(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.
\]

Substituting \(a + b = 7\):

\[
7^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \implies 49 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.
\]

Now we can express \(a^2 + b^2\) in terms of \(ab\):

\[
a^2 + b^2 = (a+b)^2 - 2ab = 49 - 2ab.
\]

We can substitute this into our earlier equation \(a^2 - ab + b^2 = 6\):

\[
(49 - 2ab) - ab = 6.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
49 - 3ab = 6.
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
3ab = 49 - 6 = 43 \implies ab = \frac{43}{3}.
\]

Now we can find \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}\):

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{a+b}{ab} = \frac{7}{\frac{43}{3}} = 7 \cdot \frac{3}{43} = \frac{21}{43}.

Thus, the final answer is:

Problem: Let $p(x)=\sqrt{-x}$, and $q(x)=8x^2+10x-3$. The domain of $p(q(x))$ can be written in the form $a\le x \le b$. Find $b-a$.
Model Response: To find the domain of \( p(q(x)) = p(8x^2 + 10x - 3) = \sqrt{-(8x^2 + 10x - 3} \), we need to ensure that the expression inside the square root is non-negative:

\[
-(8x^2 + 10x - 3) \geq 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8x^2 + 10x - 3 \leq 0
\]

Next, we will find the roots of the quadratic equation \( 8x^2 + 10x - 3 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Here, \( a = 8 \), \( b = 10 \), and \( c = -3 \):

\[
x = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{10^2 - 4 \cdot 8 \cdot (-3)}}{2 \cdot 8}
\]
\[
x = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{100 + 96}}{16}
\]
\[
x = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{196}}{16}
\]
\[
x = \frac{-10 \pm 14}{16}
\]

Calculating the two roots:

1. \( x = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4} \)
2. \( x = \frac{-24}{16} = -\frac{3}{2} \)

The roots of the quadratic are \( x = -\frac{3}{2} \) and \( x = \frac{1}{4} \). 

Next, we need to determine the intervals where \( 8x^2 + 10x - 3 \leq 0 \). The quadratic opens upwards (since \( a = 8 > 0 \)), so it is negative between its roots:

\[
-\frac{3}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{1}{4}
\]

Thus, the domain of \( p(q(x)) \) is:

\[
\left[-\frac{3}{2}, \frac{1}{4}\right]
\]

To find \( b - a \):

\[
b - a = \frac{1}{4} - \left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{2}
\]

Converting \( \frac{3}{2} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4:

\[
\frac{3}{2} = \frac{6}{4}
\]

Now, adding the fractions:

\[
b - a = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{6}{4} = \frac{7}{4}
\]

\[

Model Response: To rewrite the expression \(-2x^2 - 20x - 53\) in the form \(a(x+d)^2 + e\), we will complete the square.

1. **Factor out the coefficient of \(x^2\)**:
   \[
   -2(x^2 + 10x) - 53
   \]

2. **Complete the square for the expression inside the parentheses**:
   - Take half of the coefficient of \(x\) (which is \(10\)), square it, and add/subtract it inside the parentheses:
   \[
   -2\left(x^2 + 10x + 25 - 25\right) - 53
   \]
   - This simplifies to:
   \[
   -2\left((x + 5)^2 - 25\right) - 53
   \]

3. **Distribute the \(-2\)**:
   \[
   -2(x + 5)^2 + 50 - 53

Problem: Sue can either borrow $10,\!000$ dollars for $5$ years with a simple interest of $7\%$ annually or an interest which compounds annually for $6\%$. How much more money, rounded to the nearest dollar, would she have to pay back for the more expensive interest than the less expensive interest?
Model Response: To find out how much more Sue would have to pay back for the more expensive interest, we first calculate the total amount she would pay back for both the simple interest and the compounded interest.

**1. Simple Interest Calculation:**

The formula for simple interest is given by:

\[
A = P(1 + rt)
\]

where:
- \( A \) is the total amount to be paid back,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial loan),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),
- \( t \) is the time in years.

For Sue's simple interest loan:
- \( P = 10,000 \)
- \( r = 0.07 \)
- \( t = 5 \)

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
A = 10000(1 + 0.07 \cdot 5) = 10000(1 + 0.35) = 10000 \cdot 1.35 = 13500
\]

So, the total amount to be paid back for the simple interest loan is \( 13500 \) dollars.

**2. Compounded Interest Calculation:**

The formula for compound interest is given by:

\[
A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
\]

where:
- \( A \) is the total amount to be paid back,
- \( P \) is the principal amount,
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of times interest is compounded per year,
- \( t \) is the time in years.

For Sue's compounded interest loan:
- \( P = 10,000 \)
- \( r = 0.06 \)
- \( n = 1 \) (since it compounds annually)
- \( t = 5 \)

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
A = 10000\left(1 + \frac{0.06}{1}\right)^{1 \cdot 5} = 10000(1 + 0.06)^{5} = 10000(1.06)^{5}
\]

Calculating \( (1.06)^{5} \):

\[
(1.06)^{5} \approx 1.338225
\]

Now substituting back into the formula:

\[
A \approx 10000 \cdot 1.338225 \approx 13382.25
\]

So, the total amount to be paid back for the compounded interest loan is approximately \( 13382.25 \) dollars.

**3. Difference in Amounts:**

Now we find the difference between the two amounts:

\[
\text{Difference} = 13500 - 13382.25 \approx 117.75
\]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the difference is \( 118 \) dollars.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{118}
\]

Problem: Suppose $x$ is a solution to $x^2 + 1 = 7x$. What is the sum of $x$ and its reciprocal?
Model Response: To solve the equation \( x^2 + 1 = 7x \), we first rearrange it into standard form:

\[
x^2 - 7x + 1 = 0.
\]

Next, we can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},
\]

where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), and \( c = 1 \). Plugging in these values, we have:

\[
x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 - 4}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{45}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm 3\sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Thus, the two solutions for \( x \) are:

\[
x_1 = \frac{7 + 3\sqrt{5}}{2}, \quad x_2 = \frac{7 - 3\sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Next, we need to find the sum of \( x \) and its reciprocal \( \frac{1}{x} \). The sum can be expressed as:

\[
x + \frac{1}{x} = x + \frac{1}{\frac{7 \pm 3\sqrt{5}}{2}} = x + \frac{2}{7 \pm 3\sqrt{5}}.
\]

To simplify \( x + \frac{1}{x} \), we can use the identity:

\[
x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{x^2 + 1}{x}.
\]

Since we already have \( x^2 = 7x - 1 \) from the original equation, we can substitute this into the identity:

\[
x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{(7x - 1) + 1}{x} = \frac{7x}{x} = 7.
\]

Thus, the sum of \( x \) and its reciprocal is:

\[
\boxed{7}.

Problem: If we express $3x^2 + x - 4$ in the form $a(x - h)^2 + k$, then what is $k$?
Model Response: To express the quadratic \(3x^2 + x - 4\) in the form \(a(x - h)^2 + k\), we will complete the square.

1. Start with the quadratic:
   \[
   3x^2 + x - 4
   \]

2. Factor out the coefficient of \(x^2\) from the first two terms:
   \[
   3\left(x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x\right) - 4
   \]

3. To complete the square inside the parentheses, take half of the coefficient of \(x\) (which is \(\frac{1}{3}\)), square it, and add and subtract it inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \text{Half of } \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6}, \quad \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{36}
   \]
   Thus, we rewrite the expression:
   \[
   3\left(x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{36} - \frac{1}{36}\right) - 4
   \]

4. This simplifies to:
   \[
   3\left(\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{36}\right) - 4
   \]

5. Distributing the \(3\):
   \[
   3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{3}{12} - 4
   \]
   \[
   = 3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{4} - 4
   \]

6. Convert \(-4\) to a fraction with a denominator of \(4\):
   \[
   -4 = -\frac{16}{4}
   \]

7. Combine the constants:
   \[
   -\frac{1}{4} - \frac{16}{4} = -\frac{17}{4}
   \]

8. Therefore, the expression in vertex form is:
   \[
   3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{17}{4}
   \]

From this, we can see that \(k = -\frac{17}{4}\).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{-\frac{17}{4}}
\]

Problem: A triangle is formed with edges along the line $y=\frac{2}{3}x+5$, the $x$-axis, and the line $x=k$. If the area of the triangle is less than $20$, find the sum of all possible integral values of $k$.
Model Response: To find the area of the triangle formed by the line \(y = \frac{2}{3}x + 5\), the \(x\)-axis, and the line \(x = k\), we first need to determine the points where the line intersects the \(x\)-axis and the line \(x = k\).

1. **Finding the intersection with the \(x\)-axis:**
   The intersection occurs when \(y = 0\):
   \[
   0 = \frac{2}{3}x + 5 \implies \frac{2}{3}x = -5 \implies x = -\frac{15}{2} = -7.5.
   \]
   Thus, the point of intersection with the \(x\)-axis is \(\left(-\frac{15}{2}, 0\right)\).

2. **Finding the intersection with the line \(x = k\):**
   Substituting \(x = k\) into the line equation:
   \[
   y = \frac{2}{3}k + 5.
   \]
   Thus, the point of intersection is \((k, \frac{2}{3}k + 5)\).

3. **Calculating the area of the triangle:**
   The base of the triangle is the horizontal distance from \(-\frac{15}{2}\) to \(k\), which is:
   \[
   \text{Base} = k - \left(-\frac{15}{2}\right) = k + \frac{15}{2}.
   \]
   The height of the triangle is the \(y\)-coordinate of the intersection point with the line \(x = k\):
   \[
   \text{Height} = \frac{2}{3}k + 5.
   \]
   The area \(A\) of the triangle is given by:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height} = \frac{1}{2} \left(k + \frac{15}{2}\right) \left(\frac{2}{3}k + 5\right).
   \]

4. **Setting up the inequality:**
   We want the area to be less than \(20\):
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left(k + \frac{15}{2}\right) \left(\frac{2}{3}k + 5\right) < 20.
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by \(2\):
   \[
   \left(k + \frac{15}{2}\right) \left(\frac{2}{3}k + 5\right) < 40.
   \]

5. **Expanding the left-hand side:**
   \[
   \left(k + \frac{15}{2}\right) \left(\frac{2}{3}k + 5\right) = k \cdot \frac{2}{3}k + 5k + \frac{15}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3}k + \frac{15}{2} \cdot 5.
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   = \frac{2}{3}k^2 + 5k + 5k + \frac{15}{3} = \frac{2}{3}k^2 + 10k + 5.
   \]
   Thus, we have:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}k^2 + 10k + 5 < 40.
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}k^2 + 10k - 35 < 0.
   \]
   Multiplying through by \(3\) to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   2k^2 + 30k - 105 < 0.
   \]

6. **Finding the roots of the quadratic:**
   Using the quadratic formula:
   \[
   k = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-30 \pm \sqrt{30^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-105)}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{-30 \pm \sqrt{900 + 840}}{4} = \frac{-30 \pm \sqrt{1740}}{4}.
   \]
   Simplifying \(\sqrt{1740} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 435} = 2\sqrt{435}\):
   \[
   k = \frac{-30 \pm 2\sqrt{435}}{4} = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{435}}{2}.
   \]

7. **Finding the approximate values of the roots:**
   Approximating \(\sqrt{435} \approx 20.8\):
   \[
   k_1 \approx \frac{-15 + 20.8}{2} \approx 2.9, \quad k_2 \approx \frac{-15 - 20.8}{2} \approx -17.9.
   \]

8. **Finding the integer values of \(k\):**
   The inequality \(2k^2 + 30k - 105 < 0\) holds between the roots:
   \[
   -17.9 < k < 2.9.
   \]
   The integer values of \(k\) are \(-17, -16, \ldots, 2\).

9. **Calculating the sum of the integers:**
   The integers from \(-17\) to \(2\) form an arithmetic series:
   \[
   \text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (\text{first term} + \text{last term}),
   \]
   where \(n\) is the number of terms:
   \[
   n = 2 - (-17) + 1 = 20.
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   \text{Sum} = \frac{20}{2} \cdot (-17 + 2) = 10 \cdot (-15) = -150.
   \]

Finally, the sum of all possible integral values of \(k\) is \(\boxed{-150}\).

Problem: Lana defines a function $f(x)$ which is given by the formula $$f(x) = x^2,$$ but only on a domain she has specified which consists of finitely many values $x$; she leaves the function undefined for all other $x$.

Given that the range of $f(x)$ is $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$, what is the maximum number of points that could be in its domain?
Model Response: To determine the maximum number of points that could be in the domain of the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) given that its range is \( \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\} \), we first need to identify which values of \( x \) yield outputs that fall within this range.

The function \( f(x) = x^2 \) produces non-negative outputs. Therefore, we need to find the values of \( x \) such that \( x^2 \) is one of the values in the specified range.

The possible outputs from \( f(x) \) are:
- \( f(0) = 0 \)
- \( f(1) = 1 \)
- \( f(-1) = 1 \)
- \( f(2) = 4 \)
- \( f(-2) = 4 \)
- \( f(3) = 9 \)
- \( f(-3) = 9 \)

Now, we can list the values of \( x \) that correspond to each output in the range:
- For \( 0 \): \( x = 0 \)
- For \( 1 \): \( x = 1, -1 \)
- For \( 2 \): No \( x \) values yield \( 2 \) since \( x^2 = 2 \) does not yield integer solutions.
- For \( 3 \): No \( x \) values yield \( 3 \) since \( x^2 = 3 \) does not yield integer solutions.
- For \( 4 \): \( x = 2, -2 \)
- For \( 5 \): No \( x \) values yield \( 5 \) since \( x^2 = 5 \) does not yield integer solutions.
- For \( 6 \): No \( x \) values yield \( 6 \) since \( x^2 = 6 \) does not yield integer solutions.
- For \( 7 \): No \( x \) values yield \( 7 \) since \( x^2 = 7 \) does not yield integer solutions.
- For \( 8 \): No \( x \) values yield \( 8 \) since \( x^2 = 8 \) does not yield integer solutions.
- For \( 9 \): \( x = 3, -3 \)

Now, we can summarize the unique \( x \) values that correspond to the outputs in the range:
- \( 0 \): \( 0 \)
- \( 1 \): \( 1, -1 \)
- \( 4 \): \( 2, -2 \)
- \( 9 \): \( 3, -3 \)

Counting these values, we have:
- \( 0 \) contributes \( 1 \) point.
- \( 1 \) contributes \( 2 \) points.
- \( 4 \) contributes \( 2 \) points.
- \( 9 \) contributes \( 2 \) points.

Adding these together gives:
\[
1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7
\]

Thus, the maximum number of points that could be in the domain of \( f(x) \) is \( 7 \).

The final answer is \(\boxed{7}\).

Problem: If $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive integers such that $6xyz+30xy+21xz+2yz+105x+10y+7z=812$, find $x+y+z$.
Model Response: To solve the equation 

\[
6xyz + 30xy + 21xz + 2yz + 105x + 10y + 7z = 812,
\]

we can start by rearranging the terms and factoring where possible. 

First, let's rewrite the equation:

\[
6xyz + 30xy + 21xz + 2yz + 105x + 10y + 7z - 812 = 0.
\]

This is a polynomial in three variables \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). To find integer solutions, we can try to express the equation in a more manageable form.

We can factor out common terms from the first few terms:

\[
6xyz + 30xy + 21xz + 2yz + 105x + 10y + 7z = 812.
\]

Notice that the coefficients suggest a possible grouping. Let's try to group the terms involving \(x\):

\[
6xyz + 30xy + 21xz + 105x + 2yz + 10y + 7z = 812.
\]

Now, we can factor out \(x\) from the first four terms:

\[
x(6yz + 30y + 21z + 105) + 2yz + 10y + 7z = 812.
\]

Next, we can analyze the equation by substituting small integer values for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) to find a solution. 

Let's try \(x = 1\):

\[
1(6yz + 30y + 21z + 105) + 2yz + 10y + 7z = 812.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
6yz + 30y + 21z + 105 + 2yz + 10y + 7z = 812,
\]

which can be combined to:

\[
(6yz + 2yz) + (30y + 10y) + (21z + 7z) + 105 = 812,
\]

or:

\[
8yz + 40y + 28z + 105 = 812.
\]

Subtracting 105 from both sides gives:

\[
8yz + 40y + 28z = 707.
\]

Now, let's try \(y = 1\):

\[
8z + 40 + 28z = 707,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
36z + 40 = 707.
\]

Subtracting 40 from both sides gives:

\[
36z = 667 \implies z = \frac{667}{36} \text{ (not an integer)}.
\]

Next, let's try \(y = 2\):

\[
8(2)z + 40(2) + 28z = 707,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
16z + 80 + 28z = 707 \implies 44z + 80 = 707.
\]

Subtracting 80 from both sides gives:

\[
44z = 627 \implies z = \frac{627}{44} \text{ (not an integer)}.
\]

Next, let's try \(y = 3\):

\[
8(3)z + 40(3) + 28z = 707,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
24z + 120 + 28z = 707 \implies 52z + 120 = 707.
\]

Subtracting 120 from both sides gives:

\[
52z = 587 \implies z = \frac{587}{52} \text{ (not an integer)}.
\]

Next, let's try \(y = 4\):

\[
8(4)z + 40(4) + 28z = 707,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
32z + 160 + 28z = 707 \implies 60z + 160 = 707.
\]

Subtracting 160 from both sides gives:

\[
60z = 547 \implies z = \frac{547}{60} \text{ (not an integer)}.
\]

Next, let's try \(y = 5\):

\[
8(5)z + 40(5) + 28z = 707,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
40z + 200 + 28z = 707 \implies 68z + 200 = 707.
\]

Subtracting 200 from both sides gives:

\[
68z = 507 \implies z = \frac{507}{68} \text{ (not an integer)}.
\]

Next, let's try \(y = 6\):

\[
8(6)z + 40(6) + 28z = 707,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
48z + 240 + 28z = 707 \implies 76z + 240 = 707.
\]

Subtracting 240 from both sides gives:

\[
76z = 467 \implies z = \frac{467}{76} \text{ (not an integer)}.
\]

Next, let's try \(y = 7\):

\[
8(7)z + 40(7) + 28z = 707,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
56z + 280 + 28z = 707 \implies 84z + 280 = 707.
\]

Subtracting 280 from both sides gives:

\[
84z = 427 \implies z = \frac{427}{84} \text{ (not an integer)}.

Next, let's try \(y = 8\):

\[
8(8)z + 40(8) + 28z = 707,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
64z + 320 + 28z = 707 \implies 92z + 320 = 707.
\]

Subtracting 320 from both sides gives:

\[
92z = 387 \implies z = \frac{387}{92} \text{ (not an integer)}.
\]

Next, let's try \(y = 9\):

\[
8(9)z + 40(9) + 28z = 707,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
72z + 360 + 28z = 707 \implies 100z + 360 = 707.

Subtracting 360 from both sides gives:

\[
100z = 347 \implies z = \frac{347}{100} \text{ (not an integer)}.

Next, let's try \(y = 10\):

\[
8(10)z + 40(10) + 28z = 707,

Problem: The polynomial $p(x) = x^2+ax+b$ has distinct roots $2a$ and $b$. Find $a+b$.
Model Response: To find \( a + b \) given that the polynomial \( p(x) = x^2 + ax + b \) has distinct roots \( 2a \) and \( b \), we can use Vieta's formulas. According to Vieta's, the sum of the roots is equal to \(-a\) and the product of the roots is equal to \(b\).

1. The sum of the roots \( 2a + b = -a \).
2. The product of the roots \( (2a)(b) = b \).

From the second equation, we can simplify:

\[
2ab = b.
\]

Assuming \( b \neq 0 \) (since the roots are distinct), we can divide both sides by \( b \):

\[
2a = 1 \implies a = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Now substituting \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) into the first equation:

\[
2a + b = -a \implies 2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + b = -\frac{1}{2} \implies 1 + b = -\frac{1}{2} \implies b = -\frac{3}{2}.
\]

Now we can find \( a + b \):

\[
a + b = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{3}{2} = -1.

Thus, the final answer is:

Problem: A ball is dropped straight down from a height of 16 feet. If it bounces back each time to a height one-half the height from which it last fell, how far will the ball have traveled when it hits the floor for the sixth time, in feet?
Model Response: To find the total distance traveled by the ball when it hits the floor for the sixth time, we can break down the journey of the ball as follows:

1. **First Drop**: The ball is dropped from a height of 16 feet. It falls 16 feet to the ground.
2. **First Bounce**: The ball bounces back to a height of \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) feet.
3. **Second Drop**: The ball falls from 8 feet back to the ground, traveling another 8 feet.
4. **Second Bounce**: The ball bounces back to a height of \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) feet.
5. **Third Drop**: The ball falls from 4 feet back to the ground, traveling another 4 feet.
6. **Third Bounce**: The ball bounces back to a height of \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) feet.
7. **Fourth Drop**: The ball falls from 2 feet back to the ground, traveling another 2 feet.
8. **Fourth Bounce**: The ball bounces back to a height of \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) foot.
9. **Fifth Drop**: The ball falls from 1 foot back to the ground, traveling another 1 foot.
10. **Fifth Bounce**: The ball bounces back to a height of \( \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \) feet.
11. **Sixth Drop**: The ball falls from 0.5 feet back to the ground, traveling another 0.5 feet.

Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled:

- Distance for the first drop: \( 16 \) feet
- Distance for the first bounce: \( 8 \) feet (up)
- Distance for the second drop: \( 8 \) feet
- Distance for the second bounce: \( 4 \) feet (up)
- Distance for the third drop: \( 4 \) feet
- Distance for the third bounce: \( 2 \) feet (up)
- Distance for the fourth drop: \( 2 \) feet
- Distance for the fourth bounce: \( 1 \) foot (up)
- Distance for the fifth drop: \( 1 \) foot
- Distance for the fifth bounce: \( 0.5 \) feet (up)
- Distance for the sixth drop: \( 0.5 \) feet

Now, summing these distances:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 16 + 8 + 8 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.5
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

\[
= 16 + 8 + 8 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.5

\[
= 16 + 8 + 8 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1

\[

Problem: The quadratic $3x^2-24x+72$ can be written in the form $a(x+b)^2+c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. What is $a+b+c$?
Model Response: To rewrite the quadratic \(3x^2 - 24x + 72\) in the form \(a(x+b)^2+c\), we will complete the square.

1. **Factor out the coefficient of \(x^2\)**:
   \[
   3(x^2 - 8x) + 72
   \]

2. **Complete the square**:
   - Take the coefficient of \(x\) (which is \(-8\)), halve it to get \(-4\), and square it to get \(16\).
   - Add and subtract \(16\) inside the parentheses:
   \[
   3(x^2 - 8x + 16 - 16) + 72
   \]
   \[
   = 3((x - 4)^2 - 16) + 72
   \]

3. **Distribute the \(3\)**:
   \[
   = 3(x - 4)^2 - 48 + 72
   \]
   \[
   = 3(x - 4)^2 + 24
   \]

Now we have the quadratic in the form \(a(x+b)^2+c\):
- \(a = 3\)
- \(b = -4\) (since \(x - 4\) means \(b = -4\))
- \(c = 24\)

4. **Calculate \(a + b + c\)**:
   \[
   a + b + c = 3 - 4 + 24 = 23
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{23}
\]

Problem: Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are nonzero real numbers, and that the equation  $${x^2 + ax + b = 0}$$ has solutions $a$ and $b$. Then what is the pair $(a,b)$?
Model Response: The given conditions imply that the quadratic equation \(x^2 + ax + b = 0\) has roots \(a\) and \(b\). By Vieta's formulas, we know that:

1. The sum of the roots \(a + b = -a\)
2. The product of the roots \(ab = b\)

From the first equation, we can rearrange it to find:

\[
a + b + a = 0 \implies 2a + b = 0 \implies b = -2a
\]

Now substituting \(b = -2a\) into the second equation:

\[
a(-2a) = -2a
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-2a^2 = -2a
\]

Dividing both sides by \(-2\) (noting that \(a \neq 0\)) gives:

\[
a^2 = a
\]

This implies:

\[
a(a - 1) = 0
\]

Thus, \(a = 1\) (since \(a \neq 0\)). Substituting \(a = 1\) back into the equation for \(b\):

\[
b = -2(1) = -2
\]

Therefore, the pair \((a, b)\) is:

\[
\boxed{(1, -2)}
\]
