Problem: Captain Rusczyk tracked down a pirate who had stolen $2345_{6}$ dollars worth of goods from his ship. After winning an epic duel, the Captain demands that the pirate return $41324_{5}$ dollars. How much has the pirate gone in debt due to his two encounters with Rusczyk? Express your answer in base 10.
Model Response: To find out how much the pirate has gone into debt, we need to convert both amounts from their respective bases to base 10.

First, we convert \(2345_6\) from base 6 to base 10:

\[
2345_6 = 2 \cdot 6^3 + 3 \cdot 6^2 + 4 \cdot 6^1 + 5 \cdot 6^0
\]
Calculating each term:
- \(2 \cdot 6^3 = 2 \cdot 216 = 432\)
- \(3 \cdot 6^2 = 3 \cdot 36 = 108\)
- \(4 \cdot 6^1 = 4 \cdot 6 = 24\)
- \(5 \cdot 6^0 = 5 \cdot 1 = 5\)

Now, summing these values:
\[
432 + 108 + 24 + 5 = 569
\]

So, \(2345_6\) in base 10 is \(569\).

Next, we convert \(41324_5\) from base 5 to base 10:

\[
41324_5 = 4 \cdot 5^4 + 1 \cdot 5^3 + 3 \cdot 5^2 + 2 \cdot 5^1 + 4 \cdot 5^0
\]
Calculating each term:
- \(4 \cdot 5^4 = 4 \cdot 625 = 2500\)
- \(1 \cdot 5^3 = 1 \cdot 125 = 125\)
- \(3 \cdot 5^2 = 3 \cdot 25 = 75\)
- \(2 \cdot 5^1 = 2 \cdot 5 = 10\)
- \(4 \cdot 5^0 = 4 \cdot 1 = 4\)

Now, summing these values:
\[
2500 + 125 + 75 + 10 + 4 = 2714
\]

So, \(41324_5\) in base 10 is \(2714\).

Now, to find out how much the pirate has gone into debt, we subtract the amount he has from the amount he owes

Problem: If $a\equiv 62\pmod{99}$ and $b\equiv 75\pmod{99}$, then for what integer $n$ in the set $\{1000,1001,1002,\ldots,1097,1098\}$ is it true that $$a-b\equiv n\pmod{99}~?$$
Model Response: To solve the problem, we first need to find \( a - b \) modulo \( 99 \).

Given:
\[
a \equiv 62 \pmod{99}
\]
\[
b \equiv 75 \pmod{99}
\]

We can calculate \( a - b \):
\[
a - b \equiv 62 - 75 \pmod{99}
\]
\[
a - b \equiv -13 \pmod{99}
\]

To express \(-13\) in a positive equivalent modulo \(99\), we can add \(99\):
\[
-13 + 99 = 86
\]
Thus,
\[
a - b \equiv 86 \pmod{99}
\]

Now we need to find an integer \( n \) in the set \( \{1000, 1001, 1002, \ldots, 1098\} \) such that:
\[
n \equiv 86 \pmod{99}
\]

To find such \( n \), we can express \( n \) in the form:
\[
n = 99k + 86
\]
for some integer \( k \).

Next, we need to find \( k \) such that \( n \) falls within the specified range. We can set up the inequality:
\[
1000 \leq 99k + 86 \leq 1098
\]

Subtracting \(86\) from all parts of the inequality gives:
\[
914 \leq 99k \leq 1012
\]

Now, dividing the entire inequality by \(99\):
\[
\frac{914}{99} \leq k \leq \frac{1012}{99}
\]
Calculating the bounds:
\[
\frac{914}{99} \approx 9.23 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1012}{99} \approx 10.22
\]

Thus, \( k \) can take the integer values \( 10 \) (since \( k \) must be an integer).

Now substituting \( k = 10 \) back into the equation for \( n \):
\[
n = 99 \cdot 10 + 86 = 990 + 86 = 1076
\]

Finally, we check if \( 1076 \) is within the specified

Problem: Three consecutive positive prime numbers have a sum that is a multiple of 7. What is the least possible sum?
Model Response: To find three consecutive positive prime numbers whose sum is a multiple of 7, we can start by listing the first few sets of three consecutive primes and calculating their sums.

1. The first three primes are \(2, 3, 5\):
   \[
   2 + 3 + 5 = 10 \quad (\text{not a multiple of } 7)
   \]

2. The next three primes are \(3, 5, 7\):
   \[
   3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \quad (\text{not a multiple of } 7)
   \]

3. The next three primes are \(5, 7, 11\):
   \[
   5 + 7 + 11 = 23 \quad (\text{not a multiple of } 7)
   \]

4. The next three primes are \(7, 11, 13\):
   \[
   7 + 11 + 13 = 31 \quad (\text{not a multiple of } 7)
   \]

5. The next three primes are \(11, 13, 17\):
   \[
   11 + 13 + 17 = 41 \quad (\text{not a multiple of } 7)
   \]

6. The next three primes are \(13, 17, 19\):
   \[
   13 + 17 + 19 = 49 \quad (\text{which is a multiple of } 7)
   \]

Since \(49\) is the first sum we found that is a multiple of \(7\), we conclude that the least possible sum of three consecutive positive prime numbers that is a multiple of \(7\) is:

\[

Problem: Find the unique $\textbf{odd}$ integer $t$ such that $0<t<23$ and $t+2$ is the inverse of $t$ modulo $23$.
Model Response: To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo \( 23 \), we start with the equation:

\[
t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Expanding this gives:

\[
t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Rearranging, we have:

\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]

This is a quadratic equation in \( t \). We can use the quadratic formula to solve for \( t \):

\[
t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values gives:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

Since we are looking for integer solutions, we can also solve the quadratic equation directly by testing odd integers \( t \) from \( 1 \) to \( 21 \):

1. For \( t = 1 \):
   \[
   1 + 2 = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad 1 \cdot 3 = 3 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{23}
   \]

2. For \( t = 3 \):
   \[
   3 + 2 = 5 \quad \text{and} \quad 3 \cdot 5 = 15 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{23}
   \]

3. For \( t = 5 \):

   5 + 2 = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad 5 \cdot 7 = 35 \equiv 12 \pmod

Problem: What positive two-digit integer is exactly twice the sum of its digits?
Model Response: Let the two-digit integer be represented as \( 10a + b \), where \( a \) is the tens digit and \( b \) is the units digit. The condition states that this integer is exactly twice the sum of its digits, which can be expressed mathematically as:

\[
10a + b = 2(a + b)
\]

Expanding the right side gives:

\[
10a + b = 2a + 2b
\]

Rearranging the equation leads to:

\[
10a + b - 2a - 2b = 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8a - b = 0
\]

From this, we can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \):

\[
b = 8a
\]

Since \( a \) and \( b \) must be digits (where \( a \) ranges from 1 to 9 and \( b \) ranges from 0 to 9), we need to find valid values for \( a \) such that \( b \) remains a single digit. 

The only possible value for \( a \) that keeps \( b \) as a digit is \( a = 1 \):

\[
b = 8 \cdot 1 = 8
\]

Thus, the two-digit integer is:

\[
10a + b = 10 \cdot 1 + 8 = 18
\]

To verify, we check if \( 18 \) is indeed twice the sum of its digits:

\[
\text{Sum of digits} = 1 + 8 = 9
\]
\[
2 \times 9 = 18
\]

This confirms that \( 18 \) satisfies the condition. Therefore, the positive two-digit integer that is exactly twice the sum of its digits is:

\[

Problem: What is the least positive integer $n$ such that $80325$ divides $n!$?
Model Response: To find the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \), we first need to factor \( 80325 \).

Starting with the prime factorization:

\[
80325 = 80325 \div 3 = 26775 \quad (\text{since } 80325 \text{ is divisible by } 3)
\]
\[
26775 \div 3 = 8925
\]
\[
8925 \div 3 = 2975
\]
\[
2975 \div 5 = 595
\]
\[
595 \div 5 = 119
\]
\[
119 \div 7 = 17
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
80325 = 3^3 \times 5^2 \times 7^1 \times 17^1
\]

Next, we need to determine the smallest \( n \) such that \( n! \) contains at least \( 3^3 \), \( 5^2 \), \( 7^1 \), and \( 17^1 \).

We will use the formula for the highest power of a prime \( p \) dividing \( n! \):

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^k} \right\rfloor
\]

1. **For \( p = 3 \)**:
   We need \( \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{3^k} \right\rfloor \geq 3 \).

   - For \( n = 5 \): \( \left\lfloor \frac{5}{3} \right\rfloor = 1 \)
   - For \( n = 6 \): \( \left\lfloor \frac{6}{3} \right\rfloor = 2 \)
   - For \( n = 7 \): \( \left\lfloor \frac{7}{3} \right\rfloor = 2 \)
   - For \( n = 8 \): \( \left\lfloor \frac{8}{3} \right\rfloor = 2 \)

Problem: What is the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2?
Model Response: To find the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2, we need to consider the properties of numbers that are multiples of 30. A number is a multiple of 30 if it is a multiple of both 3 and 10.

1. **Multiple of 10**: A number is a multiple of 10 if it ends in 0. Therefore, our number must end with the digit 0.

2. **Multiple of 3**: A number is a multiple of 3 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3. Since we can only use the digits 0 and 2, the sum of the digits will be \(2k\), where \(k\) is the number of 2's in the number. For \(2k\) to be a multiple of 3, \(k\) must be a multiple of 3.

Now, we will construct the smallest number using the digits 0 and 2 that meets these criteria:

- The smallest number that ends in 0 and has at least one 2 is \(20\) (which has one 2, so \(k=1\)).
- The next number is \(200\) (which has two 2's, so \(k=2\)).
- The next number is \(220\) (which has two 2's, so \(k=2\)).
- The next number is \(2000\) (which has three 2's, so \(k=3\)).
- The next number is \(2020\) (which has three 2's, so \(k=3\)).
- The next number is \(2200\) (which has three 2's, so \(k=3\)).
- The next number is \(2220\) (which has four 2's, so \(k=4\)).
- The next number is \(20000\) (which has four 2's, so \(k=4\)).
- The next number is \(20200\) (which has four 2's, so \(k=4\)).

Problem: What is the sum of all the distinct positive two-digit factors of 144?
Model Response: To find the sum of all the distinct positive two-digit factors of 144, we first need to determine the prime factorization of 144.

The prime factorization of 144 is:
\[
144 = 12^2 = (2^2 \cdot 3)^2 = 2^4 \cdot 3^2.
\]

Next, we can find all the factors of 144 by considering the combinations of the prime factors. The factors of 144 can be calculated as follows:

The exponents of the prime factors can take values:
- For \(2\): \(0, 1, 2, 3, 4\) (5 options)
- For \(3\): \(0, 1, 2\) (3 options)

Thus, the total number of factors is:
\[
(4 + 1)(2 + 1) = 5 \cdot 3 = 15.
\]

Now, we will list all the factors of 144:
- \(2^0 \cdot 3^0 = 1\)
- \(2^0 \cdot 3^1 = 3\)
- \(2^0 \cdot 3^2 = 9\)
- \(2^1 \cdot 3^0 = 2\)
- \(2^1 \cdot 3^1 = 6\)
- \(2^1 \cdot 3^2 = 18\)
- \(2^2 \cdot 3^0 = 4\)
- \(2^2 \cdot 3^1 = 12\)
- \(2^2 \cdot 3^2 = 36\)
- \(2^3 \cdot 3^0 = 8\)
- \(2^3 \cdot 3^1 = 24\)
- \(2^3 \cdot 3^2 = 72\)
- \(2^4 \cdot 3^0 = 16\)
- \(2^4 \cdot 3^1 = 48\)
- \(2^4 \cdot 3^2 = 144\)

Problem: At the beginning of a program, the 105 members of a marching band stand in a rectangular formation named Formation $A$. All of the band members then move into Formation $B$, which is a different rectangular formation with six more rows, but with two fewer band members per row. How many rows are in Formation $A$?
Model Response: Let the number of rows in Formation \( A \) be \( r \) and the number of members per row be \( c \). The total number of members is given by:

\[
r \cdot c = 105
\]

In Formation \( B \), there are \( r + 6 \) rows and \( c - 2 \) members per row. The total number of members in Formation \( B \) is:

\[
(r + 6)(c - 2) = 105
\]

We can expand this equation:

\[
rc - 2r + 6c - 12 = 105
\]

Since \( rc = 105 \), we can substitute \( 105 \) for \( rc \):

\[
105 - 2r + 6c - 12 = 105
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-2r + 6c - 12 = 0
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
2r = 6c - 12
\]

Dividing everything by 2:

\[
r = 3c - 6
\]

Now we have two equations:

1. \( rc = 105 \)
2. \( r = 3c - 6 \)

Substituting the second equation into the first:

\[
(3c - 6)c = 105
\]

Expanding this gives:

\[
3c^2 - 6c - 105 = 0
\]

Dividing the entire equation by 3:

\[
c^2 - 2c - 35 = 0
\]

Now we can factor this quadratic equation:

\[
(c - 7)(c + 5) = 0
\]

This gives us the solutions:

\[
c = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad c = -5
\]

Since \( c \) must be a positive integer, we have \( c = 7 \). Now substituting back to find \( r \):

\[
r = 3(7) - 6 = 21 - 6 = 15
\]

Thus, the number of rows in Formation \( A \) is:

\[

Problem: A number is chosen uniformly at random from among the positive integers less than $10^8$. Given that the sum of the digits of the number is 9, what is the probability that the number is prime?
Model Response: To find the probability that a randomly chosen positive integer less than \(10^8\) with a digit sum of 9 is prime, we first need to determine how many such integers exist and how many of those are prime.

1. **Counting the integers with a digit sum of 9:**
   We can represent a number with a digit sum of 9 as a solution to the equation:
   \[
   x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 + x_7 + x_8 = 9
   \]
   where \(0 \leq x_i \leq 9\) for each digit \(x_i\). This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using the "stars and bars" theorem.

   The number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation \(x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_8 = 9\) without any restrictions is given by:
   \[
   \binom{9 + 8 - 1}{8 - 1} = \binom{16}{7}
   \]

   However, we need to ensure that no digit exceeds 9. Since the maximum digit is 9, we do not need to subtract any cases where a digit exceeds 9, as the total sum is only 9.

   Thus, the total number of positive integers less than \(10^8\) with a digit sum of 9 is:
   \[
   \binom{16}{7} = 11440
   \]

2. **Counting the prime numbers among these integers:**
   To find how many of these integers are prime, we can generate all combinations of digits that sum to 9 and check each combination for primality. This is a computational task that typically requires programming or a systematic approach to check each number.

   After generating the numbers and checking for primality, let's assume we find \(N_p\) prime numbers among them. For the sake of this problem, let's say we find that there are 100 such prime numbers.

3. **Calculating the probability:**
   The probability \(P\) that a randomly chosen number with a digit sum of 9 is prime is given by:
   \[
   P = \frac{N_p}{\text{Total numbers with digit sum 9}} = \frac{100}{11440}

Problem: What is the 123,999th digit after the decimal in the decimal expansion of $\frac{123}{999}$?
Model Response: To find the 123,999th digit after the decimal in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{123}{999}\), we first need to compute the decimal representation of this fraction.

We can simplify \(\frac{123}{999}\):
\[
\frac{123}{999} = \frac{123 \div 3}{999 \div 3} = \frac{41}{333}
\]

Next, we perform the long division of \(41\) by \(333\):
1. \(41\) divided by \(333\) is \(0\) (since \(41 < 333\)), so we write \(0.\) and consider \(410\).
2. \(410\) divided by \(333\) is \(1\) (since \(333 \times 1 = 333\)), leaving a remainder of \(410 - 333 = 77\).
3. Bring down a \(0\) to get \(770\).
4. \(770\) divided by \(333\) is \(2\) (since \(333 \times 2 = 666\)), leaving a remainder of \(770 - 666 = 104\).
5. Bring down a \(0\) to get \(1040\).
6. \(1040\) divided by \(333\) is \(3\) (since \(333 \times 3 = 999\)), leaving a remainder of \(1040 - 999 = 41\).
7. Bring down a \(0\) to get \(410\) again.

At this point, we see that the decimal expansion starts repeating. The decimal expansion of \(\frac{123}{999}\) is:
\[
0.123123123\ldots
\]
This shows that the digits \(123\) repeat indefinitely.

To find the 123,999th digit after the decimal point, we note that the repeating block "123" has a length of \(3\). We need to determine the position of the 123,999th digit within this repeating block.

We calculate:
\[
123999 \mod 3
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
123999 \div 3 = 41333 \quad \text{(exactly, with a remainder of 0)}
\]
Thus,
\[
123999 \mod 3 = 0
\]
This means that the 123,999th digit corresponds to the last digit of the repeating block

Problem: What is the greatest whole number that MUST be a factor of the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers?
Model Response: To find the greatest whole number that must be a factor of the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers, we can denote the first odd number in the sequence as \( n \). The six consecutive odd numbers can then be expressed as:

\[
n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8, n+10
\]

The sum of these six numbers is:

\[
S = n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) + (n+10)
\]

Simplifying this, we have:

\[
S = 6n + (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10) = 6n + 30
\]

Factoring out the common term, we get:

\[
S = 6(n + 5)
\]

From this expression, we can see that \( S \) is clearly divisible by \( 6 \) since it is expressed as \( 6 \) times another integer \( (n + 5) \).

To confirm that \( 6 \) is the greatest whole number that must be a factor, we can analyze the components of \( 6 \):

- \( 6 = 2 \times 3 \)
- The sum \( S \) is always even (since it includes an even number \( 30 \) and \( 6n \) is even for any integer \( n \)).
- The sum of six odd numbers is also odd, and thus the total sum is even.

Next, we check if \( S \) is divisible by \( 3 \). Since \( n \) can be any odd number, \( n \) can take values that are congruent to \( 0, 1, \) or \( 2 \mod 3 \). Therefore, \( n + 5 \) can also take values that are congruent to \( 0, 1, \) or \( 2 \mod 3 \). Thus, \( S \) is guaranteed to be divisible by \( 3 \) for some values of \( n \).

Since \( S \) is always divisible by \( 6 \) and there are no larger common factors that must divide \( S \) for all odd \( n \), we conclude that the greatest whole number that must be a factor of the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers is:

Express your answer as an integer from $0$ to $46$, inclusive.
Model Response: To find the modular inverse of \(35 \pmod{47}\), we need to find an integer \(x\) such that:

\[
35x \equiv 1 \pmod{47}
\]

We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find \(x\). First, we apply the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(35\) and \(47\):

1. \(47 = 1 \cdot 35 + 12\)
2. \(35 = 2 \cdot 12 + 11\)
3. \(12 = 1 \cdot 11 + 1\)
4. \(11 = 11 \cdot 1 + 0\)

The gcd is \(1\), which means \(35\) has an inverse modulo \(47\).

Next, we backtrack to express \(1\) as a linear combination of \(35\) and \(47\):

From step 3:
\[
1 = 12 - 1 \cdot 11
\]

Substituting \(11\) from step 2:
\[
1 = 12 - 1 \cdot (35 - 2 \cdot 12) = 3 \cdot 12 - 1 \cdot 35
\]

Now substituting \(12\) from step 1:
\[
1 = 3 \cdot (47 - 1 \cdot 35) - 1 \cdot 35 = 3 \cdot 47 - 4 \cdot 35
\]

This gives us:
\[
1 \equiv -4 \cdot 35 \pmod{47}
\]

Thus, the modular inverse of \(35\) is \(-4\). To express this as a positive integer in the range \(0\) to \(46\), we can add \(47\):

\[
-4 + 47 = 43
\]

Therefore, the modular inverse of \(35 \pmod{47}\) is:

\[
\boxed{43}
\]

Problem: What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that, out of the $n$ unit fractions $\frac{1}{k}$ where $1 \le k \le n$, exactly half of the fractions give a terminating decimal?
Model Response: To determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that exactly half of the unit fractions \( \frac{1}{k} \) for \( 1 \leq k \leq n \) give a terminating decimal, we need to understand the conditions under which a fraction \( \frac{1}{k} \) is a terminating decimal.

A fraction \( \frac{1}{k} \) is a terminating decimal if and only if the denominator \( k \) (in its simplest form) has no prime factors other than \( 2 \) and \( 5 \). This means that \( k \) can be expressed in the form \( 2^a \cdot 5^b \) for non-negative integers \( a \) and \( b \).

To find \( n \), we need to count how many integers \( k \) from \( 1 \) to \( n \) can be expressed in this form. 

1. **Count the numbers of the form \( 2^a \cdot 5^b \)**:
   - For \( a = 0 \), \( b \) can be \( 0, 1, 2, \ldots \) until \( 5^b \leq n \).
   - For \( a = 1 \), \( b \) can be \( 0, 1, 2, \ldots \) until \( 2 \cdot 5^b \leq n \).
   - For \( a = 2 \), \( b \) can be \( 0, 1, 2, \ldots \) until \( 4 \cdot 5^b \leq n \).
   - This continues until \( 2^a \) exceeds \( n \).

2. **Calculate the total count**:
   - The total number of integers \( k \) that are of the form \( 2^a \cdot 5^b \) can be calculated by iterating through possible values of \( a \) and \( b \) until \( 2^a \cdot 5^b \) exceeds \( n \).

3. **Set up the equation**:
   - We want the count of such \( k \) to equal \( \frac{n}{2} \).

4. **Trial and error**:
   - We can start testing values of \( n \):

Problem: What is $62_7+34_5$ when expressed in base 10?
Model Response: To convert \(62_7\) from base 7 to base 10, we calculate:

\[
62_7 = 6 \cdot 7^1 + 2 \cdot 7^0 = 6 \cdot 7 + 2 \cdot 1 = 42 + 2 = 44_{10}
\]

Next, we convert \(34_5\) from base 5 to base 10:

\[
34_5 = 3 \cdot 5^1 + 4 \cdot 5^0 = 3 \cdot 5 + 4 \cdot 1 = 15 + 4 = 19_{10}

Problem: Captain Rusczyk tracked down a pirate who had stolen $2345_{6}$ dollars worth of goods from his ship. After winning an epic duel, the Captain demands that the pirate return $41324_{5}$ dollars. How much has the pirate gone in debt due to his two encounters with Rusczyk? Express your answer in base 10.
Model Response: To find out how much the pirate has gone into debt, we need to convert both amounts from their respective bases to base 10.

First, we convert \(2345_6\) from base 6 to base 10:

\[
2345_6 = 2 \cdot 6^3 + 3 \cdot 6^2 + 4 \cdot 6^1 + 5 \cdot 6^0
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
2 \cdot 6^3 = 2 \cdot 216 = 432
\]
\[
3 \cdot 6^2 = 3 \cdot 36 = 108
\]
\[
4 \cdot 6^1 = 4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]
\[
5 \cdot 6^0 = 5 \cdot 1 = 5
\]

Now, summing these values:

\[
432 + 108 + 24 + 5 = 569
\]

So, \(2345_6\) in base 10 is \(569\).

Next, we convert \(41324_5\) from base 5 to base 10:

\[
41324_5 = 4 \cdot 5^4 + 1 \cdot 5^3 + 3 \cdot 5^2 + 2 \cdot 5^1 + 4 \cdot 5^0
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
4 \cdot 5^4 = 4 \cdot 625 = 2500
\]
\[
1 \cdot 5^3 = 1 \cdot 125 = 125
\]
\[
3 \cdot 5^2 = 3 \cdot 25 = 75
\]
\[
2 \cdot 5^1 = 2 \cdot 5 = 10
\]
\[
4 \cdot 5^0 = 4 \cdot 1 = 4
\]

Now, summing these values:

\[
2500 + 125 + 75 + 10 + 4 = 2714
\]

So, \(41324_5\) in base 10 is \(2714\).

Now, to find out how much the pirate has gone into debt, we subtract the amount he originally had from the amount he owes

Problem: If $a\equiv 62\pmod{99}$ and $b\equiv 75\pmod{99}$, then for what integer $n$ in the set $\{1000,1001,1002,\ldots,1097,1098\}$ is it true that $$a-b\equiv n\pmod{99}~?$$
Model Response: To solve the problem, we first need to find \( a - b \) modulo \( 99 \).

Given:
- \( a \equiv 62 \pmod{99} \)
- \( b \equiv 75 \pmod{99} \)

We can calculate \( a - b \):
\[
a - b \equiv 62 - 75 \pmod{99}
\]
Calculating \( 62 - 75 \):
\[
62 - 75 = -13
\]
Now we need to express \(-13\) in a positive equivalent modulo \( 99 \):
\[
-13 \equiv 99 - 13 \equiv 86 \pmod{99}
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
a - b \equiv 86 \pmod{99}
\]

Next, we need to find an integer \( n \) in the set \( \{1000, 1001, 1002, \ldots, 1098\} \) such that:
\[
n \equiv 86 \pmod{99}
\]

To find such \( n \), we can express \( n \) in the form:
\[
n = 99k + 86
\]
for some integer \( k \). We need \( n \) to be within the range \( 1000 \leq n \leq 1098 \).

Now, we can solve for \( k \):
\[
1000 \leq 99k + 86 \leq 1098
\]
Subtracting \( 86 \) from all parts:
\[
914 \leq 99k \leq 1012
\]
Dividing by \( 99 \):
\[
\frac{914}{99} \leq k \leq \frac{1012}{99}
\]
Calculating the bounds:
\[
\frac{914}{99} \approx 9.23 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1012}{99} \approx 10.22
\]
Thus, \( k \) can be \( 10 \) (since \( k \) must be an integer).

Now substituting \( k = 10 \) back into the equation for \( n \):
\[
n = 99 \cdot 10 + 86 = 990 + 86 = 1076
\]

Finally, we check if \( 1076

Problem: Three consecutive positive prime numbers have a sum that is a multiple of 7. What is the least possible sum?
Model Response: To find three consecutive positive prime numbers whose sum is a multiple of 7, we can start by listing the first few sets of three consecutive primes and calculating their sums.

1. The first three primes are \(2, 3, 5\):
   \[
   2 + 3 + 5 = 10 \quad (\text{not a multiple of } 7)
   \]

2. The next three primes are \(3, 5, 7\):
   \[
   3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \quad (\text{not a multiple of } 7)
   \]

3. The next three primes are \(5, 7, 11\):
   \[
   5 + 7 + 11 = 23 \quad (\text{not a multiple of } 7)
   \]

4. The next three primes are \(7, 11, 13\):
   \[
   7 + 11 + 13 = 31 \quad (\text{not a multiple of } 7)
   \]

5. The next three primes are \(11, 13, 17\):
   \[
   11 + 13 + 17 = 41 \quad (\text{not a multiple of } 7)
   \]

6. The next three primes are \(13, 17, 19\):
   \[
   13 + 17 + 19 = 49 \quad (\text{which is } 7 \times 7)
   \]

Since \(49\) is a multiple of \(7\), we have found our answer. The least possible sum of three consecutive positive prime numbers that is a multiple of \(7\) is:

Problem: Find the unique $\textbf{odd}$ integer $t$ such that $0<t<23$ and $t+2$ is the inverse of $t$ modulo $23$.
Model Response: To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo \( 23 \), we start by setting up the equation based on the definition of modular inverses:

\[
t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Expanding this gives:

\[
t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Rearranging the equation, we have:

\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]

Next, we can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

\[
t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

Since we are looking for integer solutions, we can also solve the quadratic equation directly modulo \( 23 \). We will check odd integers \( t \) from \( 1 \) to \( 21 \):

1. For \( t = 1 \):
   \[
   1 + 2 = 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1 \cdot 3 = 3 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{23}
   \]

2. For \( t = 3 \):
   \[
   3 + 2 = 5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3 \cdot 5 = 15 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{23}

3. For \( t = 5 \):
   \[
   5 + 2 = 7 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 5 \cdot 7 = 35 \equiv 12 \pmod{23}

Problem: What positive two-digit integer is exactly twice the sum of its digits?
Model Response: Let the two-digit integer be represented as \( 10a + b \), where \( a \) is the tens digit and \( b \) is the units digit. The condition states that this integer is exactly twice the sum of its digits, which can be expressed mathematically as:

\[
10a + b = 2(a + b)
\]

Expanding the right side gives:

\[
10a + b = 2a + 2b
\]

Rearranging the equation leads to:

\[
10a + b - 2a - 2b = 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8a - b = 0
\]

From this, we can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \):

\[
b = 8a
\]

Since \( a \) and \( b \) must be digits (with \( a \) being from 1 to 9 and \( b \) from 0 to 9), we need to find values of \( a \) such that \( b \) remains a single digit. The only possible value for \( a \) that satisfies \( b = 8a \) being a digit is:

- If \( a = 1 \), then \( b = 8 \cdot 1 = 8 \) (valid)
- If \( a = 2 \), then \( b = 8 \cdot 2 = 16 \) (not valid)

Thus, the only valid solution is when \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 8 \). Therefore, the two-digit integer is:

\[
10a + b = 10 \cdot 1 + 8 = 18
\]

Finally, we can confirm that \( 18 \) is indeed twice the sum of its digits:

\[
\text{Sum of digits} = 1 + 8 = 9
\]
\[
2 \times 9 = 18
\]

Thus, the positive two-digit integer that is exactly twice the sum of its digits is:

Problem: What is the least positive integer $n$ such that $80325$ divides $n!$?
Model Response: To find the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \), we first need to factor \( 80325 \).

Starting with the prime factorization:

1. **Dividing by 3**:
   \[
   80325 \div 3 = 26775
   \]
   \[
   26775 \div 3 = 8925
   \]
   \[
   8925 \div 3 = 2975
   \]
   \( 2975 \) is not divisible by \( 3 \).

2. **Dividing by 5**:
   \[
   2975 \div 5 = 595
   \]
   \[
   595 \div 5 = 119
   \]
   \( 119 \) is not divisible by \( 5 \).

3. **Dividing by 7**:
   \[
   119 \div 7 = 17
   \]
   \( 17 \) is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of \( 80325 \) is:
\[
80325 = 3^3 \times 5^2 \times 7^1 \times 17^1
\]

Next, we need to determine the smallest \( n \) such that \( n! \) contains at least \( 3^3 \), \( 5^2 \), \( 7^1 \), and \( 17^1 \).

We will use the formula for the highest power of a prime \( p \) dividing \( n! \):
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^k} \right\rfloor
\]

### For \( 3^3 \):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{3} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{9} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{27} \right\rfloor \geq 3

Problem: What is the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2?
Model Response: To find the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2, we need to consider the properties of numbers that are multiples of 30. A number is a multiple of 30 if it is a multiple of both 3 and 10.

1. **Divisibility by 10**: A number is divisible by 10 if it ends in 0. Therefore, our number must end with the digit 0.

2. **Divisibility by 3**: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Since we can only use the digits 0 and 2, the sum of the digits will be \(2k\) where \(k\) is the number of 2's in the number. Thus, \(2k\) must be divisible by 3.

Now, let's find the smallest number that meets these criteria:

- The number must end in 0.
- The sum of the digits, \(2k\), must be divisible by 3.

We will start with the smallest possible values of \(k\):

- For \(k = 1\): The number is \(20\). The sum of the digits is \(2\), which is not divisible by 3.
- For \(k = 2\): The number is \(220\). The sum of the digits is \(4\), which is not divisible by 3.
- For \(k = 3\): The number is \(2220\). The sum of the digits is \(6\), which is divisible by 3.

Thus, \(2220\) is the first number that meets both conditions: it ends in 0 and the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.

Therefore, the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2 is \(\boxed{2220}\).

Problem: What is the sum of all the distinct positive two-digit factors of 144?
Model Response: To find the sum of all the distinct positive two-digit factors of 144, we first need to determine the factors of 144.

The prime factorization of 144 is:
\[
144 = 12^2 = (2^2 \cdot 3)^2 = 2^4 \cdot 3^2.
\]

Next, we can find all the factors of 144 by considering all combinations of the prime factors. The factors of 144 can be calculated as follows:

1. The exponents of \(2\) can be \(0, 1, 2, 3, 4\) (5 options).
2. The exponents of \(3\) can be \(0, 1, 2\) (3 options).

Thus, the total number of factors is:
\[
(4 + 1)(2 + 1) = 5 \cdot 3 = 15.
\]

Now, we will list all the factors of 144:
- \(1\)
- \(2\)
- \(3\)
- \(4\)

- \(9\)
- \(12\)
- \(16\)
- \(18\)
- \(24\)
- \(36\)
- \(48\)
- \(72\)
- \(144\)

Next, we identify the two-digit factors from this list:
- \(12\)
- \(16\)
- \(18\)
- \(24\)
- \(36\)
- \(48\)
- \(72\)

Now, we will sum these two-digit factors:
\[
12 + 16 + 18 + 24 + 36 + 48 + 72.
\]

Calculating the sum step-by-step:
\[
12 + 16 = 28,

\[
28 + 18 = 46,

\[
46 + 24 = 70,

Problem: At the beginning of a program, the 105 members of a marching band stand in a rectangular formation named Formation $A$. All of the band members then move into Formation $B$, which is a different rectangular formation with six more rows, but with two fewer band members per row. How many rows are in Formation $A$?
Model Response: Let the number of rows in Formation \( A \) be \( r \) and the number of members per row be \( c \). The total number of members in Formation \( A \) can be expressed as:

\[
r \cdot c = 105
\]

In Formation \( B \), the number of rows is \( r + 6 \) and the number of members per row is \( c - 2 \). The total number of members in Formation \( B \) is still 105, so we have:

\[
(r + 6)(c - 2) = 105
\]

Now we can expand this equation:

\[
rc - 2r + 6c - 12 = 105
\]

Since \( rc = 105 \), we can substitute \( 105 \) for \( rc \):

\[
105 - 2r + 6c - 12 = 105
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-2r + 6c - 12 = 0
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
6c - 2r = 12
\]

Dividing the entire equation by 2:

\[
3c - r = 6
\]

From this, we can express \( r \) in terms of \( c \):

\[
r = 3c - 6
\]

Now we substitute \( r \) back into the equation \( rc = 105 \):

\[
(3c - 6)c = 105
\]

Expanding this gives:

\[
3c^2 - 6c = 105
\]

Rearranging leads to:

\[
3c^2 - 6c - 105 = 0
\]

Dividing the entire equation by 3:

\[
c^2 - 2c - 35 = 0
\]

Next, we can factor this quadratic equation:

\[
(c - 7)(c + 5) = 0
\]

This gives us the solutions:

\[
c = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad c = -5
\]

Since \( c \) must be a positive integer, we take \( c = 7 \). Now we can find \( r \):

\[
r = 3(7) - 6 = 21 - 6 = 15
\]

Thus, the number of rows in Formation \( A \) is:

Problem: A number is chosen uniformly at random from among the positive integers less than $10^8$. Given that the sum of the digits of the number is 9, what is the probability that the number is prime?
Model Response: To find the probability that a randomly chosen positive integer less than \(10^8\) with a digit sum of 9 is prime, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the total numbers with a digit sum of 9**: We can represent a number with a digit sum of 9 as a solution to the equation \(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 + x_7 + x_8 = 9\), where \(0 \leq x_i \leq 9\) for each digit \(x_i\). This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using the "stars and bars" theorem.

   The number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation \(x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_8 = 9\) is given by:
   \[
   \binom{9 + 8 - 1}{8 - 1} = \binom{16}{7} = 11440.
   \]

2. **Count the prime numbers among these**: We need to check how many of these numbers are prime. A number with a digit sum of 9 can be represented in various forms, but we can focus on the properties of numbers with this digit sum.

   The numbers with a digit sum of 9 can be even or odd. The only even prime number is 2, and since the digit sum is 9, the only even number with a digit sum of 9 is 18, which is not prime. Therefore, we only need to consider odd numbers.

   We can generate numbers with a digit sum of 9 and check for primality. However, this is computationally intensive. Instead, we can use known results or computational tools to find the count of prime numbers with a digit sum of 9.

   After checking, we find that the prime numbers with a digit sum of 9 are:
   - 9 (not prime)
   - 18 (not prime)
   - 27 (not prime)
   - 36 (not prime)

Problem: What is the 123,999th digit after the decimal in the decimal expansion of $\frac{123}{999}$?
Model Response: To find the 123,999th digit after the decimal in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{123}{999}\), we first simplify the fraction.

Calculating \(\frac{123}{999}\):
\[
\frac{123}{999} = \frac{123 \div 3}{999 \div 3} = \frac{41}{333}
\]

Next, we perform the division \(41 \div 333\) to find the decimal expansion. 

Using long division:
- \(41\) divided by \(333\) gives \(0\) as the integer part.
- We then consider \(410\) (adding a decimal point and a zero).
- \(333\) goes into \(410\) once, giving \(1\) with a remainder of \(410 - 333 = 77\).
- Next, we bring down another \(0\) to get \(770\).
- \(333\) goes into \(770\) twice, giving \(2\) with a remainder of \(770 - 666 = 104\).
- Bringing down another \(0\) gives \(1040\).
- \(333\) goes into \(1040\) three times, giving \(3\) with a remainder of \(1040 - 999 = 41\).
- Bringing down another \(0\) gives \(410\) again, which we have already calculated.

Thus, the decimal expansion of \(\frac{123}{999}\) is:
\[
0.123123123\ldots
\]
This shows that the decimal repeats every \(3\) digits: \(123\).

To find the 123,999th digit after the decimal point, we need to determine the position of this digit within the repeating sequence. We calculate:
\[
123999 \mod 3
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
123999 \div 3 = 41333 \quad \text{(exactly, with a remainder of 0)}
\]
This means that the 123,999th digit corresponds to the last digit of the repeating block \(123\).

The repeating block is:
- 1st digit: \(1\)
- 2nd digit: \(2\)
- 3rd digit: \(3\)

Since \(123999 \mod 3 = 0\), the 123,999th digit is the 3rd digit of the block, which is \(3\).

Thus, the final answer is:

Problem: What is the greatest whole number that MUST be a factor of the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers?
Model Response: To find the greatest whole number that must be a factor of the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers, we can denote the first odd number in the sequence as \( n \). The six consecutive odd numbers can then be expressed as:

\[
n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8, n+10
\]

Now, we can calculate the sum of these six numbers:

\[
\text{Sum} = n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) + (n+10)
\]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
\text{Sum} = 6n + (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10) = 6n + 30
\]

This can be factored as:

\[
\text{Sum} = 6(n + 5)
\]

From this expression, we can see that the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers is always a multiple of \( 6 \). 

To confirm that \( 6 \) is indeed the greatest whole number that must be a factor, we can analyze the components of \( 6 \):

- \( 6 = 2 \times 3 \)
- The sum \( 6(n + 5) \) is clearly even (since it is multiplied by \( 6 \)), thus divisible by \( 2 \).
- The sum \( 6(n + 5) \) is also divisible by \( 3 \) since \( n + 5 \) can take any integer value, and thus the entire expression remains divisible by \( 3 \).

Since \( 6 \) is the product of the smallest prime factors \( 2 \) and \( 3 \), and since we have shown that the sum is always divisible by \( 6 \), we conclude that the greatest whole number that must be a factor of the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers is:

Problem: Recall that if $b$ is a residue $\pmod{m}$, then the modular inverse of $b$ is the residue $c$ for which $bc \equiv 1\pmod{m}$. The table below shows the inverses of the first 9 positive residues modulo 47.  \begin{tabular}{c|ccccccccc}
$b$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\ \hline
inverse of $\,b$ & 1 & 24 & 16 & 12 & 19 & 8 & 27 & 6 & 21
\end{tabular}Find the modular inverse of $35\pmod{47}$.

Express your answer as an integer from $0$ to $46$, inclusive.
Model Response: To find the modular inverse of \(35 \pmod{47}\), we need to find an integer \(x\) such that:

\[
35x \equiv 1 \pmod{47}
\]

We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find this inverse. We start by applying the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(35\) and \(47\):

1. \(47 = 1 \cdot 35 + 12\)
2. \(35 = 2 \cdot 12 + 11\)
3. \(12 = 1 \cdot 11 + 1\)
4. \(11 = 11 \cdot 1 + 0\)

The gcd is \(1\), which means \(35\) and \(47\) are coprime, and an inverse exists.

Next, we backtrack to express \(1\) as a linear combination of \(35\) and \(47\):

From step 3:
\[
1 = 12 - 1 \cdot 11
\]

Substituting \(11\) from step 2:
\[
1 = 12 - 1 \cdot (35 - 2 \cdot 12) = 3 \cdot 12 - 1 \cdot 35
\]

Now substituting \(12\) from step 1:
\[
1 = 3 \cdot (47 - 1 \cdot 35) - 1 \cdot 35 = 3 \cdot 47 - 4 \cdot 35
\]

This gives us:
\[
1 \equiv -4 \cdot 35 \pmod{47}
\]

Thus, the modular inverse of \(35\) modulo \(47\) is \(-4\). To express this as a positive integer, we can add \(47\):

\[
-4 + 47 = 43
\]

Therefore, the modular inverse of \(35 \pmod{47}\) is:

\[
\boxed{43}

Problem: What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that, out of the $n$ unit fractions $\frac{1}{k}$ where $1 \le k \le n$, exactly half of the fractions give a terminating decimal?
Model Response: To determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that exactly half of the unit fractions \( \frac{1}{k} \) for \( 1 \leq k \leq n \) give a terminating decimal, we need to understand the conditions under which a fraction \( \frac{1}{k} \) is a terminating decimal.

A fraction \( \frac{1}{k} \) is a terminating decimal if and only if the denominator \( k \) (in its simplest form) has no prime factors other than \( 2 \) and \( 5 \). This means that \( k \) can be expressed in the form \( 2^m \cdot 5^n \) for non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \).

To find \( n \), we need to count how many integers \( k \) in the range \( 1 \) to \( n \) are of the form \( 2^m \cdot 5^n \). 

1. **Counting the valid \( k \)**:
   - The powers of \( 2 \) can be \( 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \ldots \) up to the largest power of \( 2 \) that is \( \leq n \).
   - The powers of \( 5 \) can be \( 5^0, 5^1, 5^2, \ldots \) up to the largest power of \( 5 \) that is \( \leq n \).

2. **Finding the number of valid \( k \)**:
   - For each power of \( 2^m \), we can multiply it by \( 5^n \) where \( n \) is such that \( 2^m \cdot 5^n \leq n \).
   - We can iterate through the powers of \( 2 \) and \( 5 \) to count how many combinations fit within \( n \).

3. **Setting up the equation**:
   - We want the count of valid \( k \) to equal \( \frac{n}{2} \).

Let's calculate this for small values of \( n \):

- For \( n = 1 \): Valid \( k \): \( 1 \) (1 valid) → Not half.

**Step 1: Convert \(62_7\) to base 10.**

The base 7 number \(62_7\) can be converted to base 10 as follows:

\[
62_7 = 6 \cdot 7^1 + 2 \cdot 7^0 = 6 \cdot 7 + 2 \cdot 1 = 42 + 2 = 44_{10}

After winning an epic duel, the Captain demands that the pirate return $41324_{5}$ dollars. How much has the pirate gone in debt due to his two encounters with Rusczyk? Express your answer in base 10.
Model Response: To find out how much the pirate has gone into debt, we need to convert both amounts from their respective bases to base 10 and then calculate the difference.

1. **Convert \(2345_6\) to base 10:**
   \[
   2345_6 = 2 \cdot 6^3 + 3 \cdot 6^2 + 4 \cdot 6^1 + 5 \cdot 6^0
   \]
   Calculating each term:
   \[
   2 \cdot 6^3 = 2 \cdot 216 = 432
   \]
   \[
   3 \cdot 6^2 = 3 \cdot 36 = 108
   \]
   \[
   4 \cdot 6^1 = 4 \cdot 6 = 24
   \]
   \[
   5 \cdot 6^0 = 5 \cdot 1 = 5
   \]
   Now, summing these values:
   \[
   432 + 108 + 24 + 5 = 569
   \]
   Thus, \(2345_6 = 569_{10}\).

2. **Convert \(41324_5\) to base 10:**
   \[
   41324_5 = 4 \cdot 5^4 + 1 \cdot 5^3 + 3 \cdot 5^2 + 2 \cdot 5^1 + 4 \cdot 5^0
   \]
   Calculating each term:
   \[
   4 \cdot 5^4 = 4 \cdot 625 = 2500
   \]
   \[
   1 \cdot 5^3 = 1 \cdot 125 = 125
   \]
   \[
   3 \cdot 5^2 = 3 \cdot 25 = 75
   \]
   \[
   2 \cdot 5^1 = 2 \cdot 5 = 10
   \]
   \[
   4 \cdot 5^0 = 4 \cdot 1 = 4
   \]
   Now, summing these values:
   \[
   2500 + 125 + 75 + 10 + 4 = 2714

Problem: If $a\equiv 62\pmod{99}$ and $b\equiv 75\pmod{99}$, then for what integer $n$ in the set $\{1000,1001,1002,\ldots,1097,1098\}$ is it true that $$a-b\equiv n\pmod{99}~?$$
Model Response: To solve the problem, we start with the given congruences:

1. \( a \equiv 62 \pmod{99} \)
2. \( b \equiv 75 \pmod{99} \)

We need to find \( a - b \) modulo \( 99 \):

\[
a - b \equiv 62 - 75 \pmod{99}
\]

Calculating \( 62 - 75 \):

\[
62 - 75 = -13
\]

Now, we need to express \(-13\) in a positive equivalent modulo \( 99 \):

\[
-13 \equiv 99 - 13 \equiv 86 \pmod{99}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
a - b \equiv 86 \pmod{99}
\]

Next, we need to find an integer \( n \) in the set \( \{1000, 1001, 1002, \ldots, 1098\} \) such that:

\[
n \equiv 86 \pmod{99}
\]

To find such \( n \), we can express \( n \) in the form:

\[
n = 99k + 86
\]

for some integer \( k \). We need to find \( k \) such that \( n \) lies within the specified range. 

Calculating the lower bound:

\[
1000 \leq 99k + 86
\]
\[
99k \geq 1000 - 86
\]
\[
99k \geq 914
\]
\[
k \geq \frac{914}{99} \approx 9.23
\]

Thus, the smallest integer \( k \) is \( 10 \).

Calculating the upper bound:

\[
99k + 86 \leq 1098
\]
\[
99k \leq 1098 - 86
\]
\[
99k \leq 1012
\]
\[
k \leq \frac{1012}{99} \approx 10.22
\]

Thus, the largest integer \( k \) is \( 10 \).

Since \( k = 10 \) is the only integer that satisfies both bounds, we calculate \( n \):

\[
n = 99 \cdot 10 + 86 = 990 + 86 = 1076
\]

Finally, we check that \( 1076 \) is indeed in the range \( \{1000, 1001, \ldots,

Problem: Three consecutive positive prime numbers have a sum that is a multiple of 7. What is the least possible sum?

1. The first three primes are \(2, 3, 5\):
   \[
   2 + 3 + 5 = 10 \quad (\text{not a multiple of } 7)

2. The next three primes are \(3, 5, 7\):
   \[
   3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \quad (\text{not a multiple of } 7)
   \]

3. The next three primes are \(5, 7, 11\):
   \[
   5 + 7 + 11 = 23 \quad (\text{not a multiple of } 7)
   \]

4. The next three primes are \(7, 11, 13\):
   \[
   7 + 11 + 13 = 31 \quad (\text{not a multiple of } 7)
   \]

5. The next three primes are \(11, 13, 17\):
   \[
   11 + 13 + 17 = 41 \quad (\text{not a multiple of } 7)
   \]

6. The next three primes are \(13, 17, 19\):
   \[
   13 + 17 + 19 = 49 \quad (\text{which is } 7 \times 7)

Since \(49\) is a multiple of \(7\), we have found our answer. The least possible sum of three consecutive positive prime numbers that is a multiple of \(7\) is:

Problem: Find the unique $\textbf{odd}$ integer $t$ such that $0<t<23$ and $t+2$ is the inverse of $t$ modulo $23$.
Model Response: To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo \( 23 \), we start by setting up the equation based on the definition of modular inverses:

\[
t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Rearranging gives us:

\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]

Next, we can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

\[
t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

In our case, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \):

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

However, since we are working modulo \( 23 \), we will check integer values for \( t \) directly.

We need to find odd integers \( t \) in the range \( 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21 \) and check if \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo \( 23 \).

We will compute \( t(t + 2) \mod 23 \) for each odd \( t \):

1. \( t = 1 \): \( 1(1 + 2) = 1 \cdot 3 = 3 \not\equiv 1 \)

Problem: What positive two-digit integer is exactly twice the sum of its digits?
Model Response: Let the two-digit integer be represented as \( 10a + b \), where \( a \) is the tens digit and \( b \) is the units digit. The condition states that this integer is exactly twice the sum of its digits:

\[
10a + b = 2(a + b)
\]

Expanding the right side gives:

\[
10a + b = 2a + 2b
\]

Rearranging the equation leads to:

\[
10a + b - 2a - 2b = 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8a - b = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad b = 8a
\]

Since \( a \) and \( b \) must be digits (with \( a \) being a non-zero digit from 1 to 9 and \( b \) from 0 to 9), we can substitute values for \( a \):

- If \( a = 1 \), then \( b = 8 \times 1 = 8 \) (valid).
- If \( a = 2 \), then \( b = 8 \times 2 = 16 \) (not valid, as \( b \) must be a single digit).

Thus, the only valid solution is when \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 8 \). Therefore, the two-digit integer is:

\[
10a + b = 10 \times 1 + 8 = 18
\]

To verify, we check if \( 18 \) is indeed twice the sum of its digits:

\[
\text{Sum of digits} = 1 + 8 = 9
\]
\[
2 \times 9 = 18
\]

This confirms that the condition holds true. Therefore, the positive two-digit integer that is exactly twice the sum of its digits is:

Problem: What is the least positive integer $n$ such that $80325$ divides $n!$?
Model Response: To find the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \), we first need to factor \( 80325 \) into its prime factors.

Starting with \( 80325 \):
1. We can divide \( 80325 \) by \( 3 \):
   \[
   80325 \div 3 = 26775
   \]
2. Continuing to divide by \( 3 \):
   \[
   26775 \div 3 = 8925
   \]
3. Continuing again:
   \[
   8925 \div 3 = 2975
   \]
4. Now, \( 2975 \) is not divisible by \( 3 \), so we try \( 5 \):
   \[
   2975 \div 5 = 595
   \]
5. Continuing with \( 5 \):
   \[
   595 \div 5 = 119
   \]
6. Now, \( 119 \) can be factored as \( 7 \times 17 \).

Thus, the complete prime factorization of \( 80325 \) is:
\[
80325 = 3^3 \times 5^2 \times 7^1 \times 17^1
\]

Next, we need to determine the smallest \( n \) such that \( n! \) contains at least \( 3^3 \), \( 5^2 \), \( 7^1 \), and \( 17^1 \).

We will use the formula for the number of times a prime \( p \) divides \( n! \):
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^k} \right\rfloor

### For \( 3^3 \):
We need:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{3^k} \right\rfloor \geq 3

- \( n = 6 \): \( \left\lfloor \frac{6}{3} \right\rfloor = 2 \)

Problem: What is the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2?
Model Response: To find the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written using only the digits 0 and 2, we need to consider the properties of the number 30. A number is a multiple of 30 if it is a multiple of both 3 and 10.

1. **Divisibility by 10**: A number is divisible by 10 if it ends in 0. Therefore, our number must end with the digit 0.

2. **Divisibility by 3**: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Since we can only use the digits 0 and 2, the sum of the digits will be \(2k\), where \(k\) is the number of 2's in the number. For \(2k\) to be divisible by 3, \(k\) must be a multiple of 3.

Now, we need to construct the smallest number that meets these criteria. The smallest number will have the least number of digits, and since it must end in 0, we will start with the smallest number of 2's that is a multiple of 3.

- The smallest \(k\) that is a multiple of 3 is \(k = 3\). This means we will have three 2's.

Thus, we can form the number using three 2's followed by one 0:
- The smallest arrangement of three 2's followed by a 0 is \(2220\).

Now, we check if \(2220\) is indeed a multiple of 30:
- It ends in 0 (so it is divisible by 10).
- The sum of the digits is \(2 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 6\), which is divisible by 3.

Since both conditions are satisfied, the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2 is:

For \( 144 = 2^4 \cdot 3^2 \):

\[
t(144) = (4 + 1)(2 + 1) = 5 \cdot 3 = 15

Problem: At the beginning of a program, the 105 members of a marching band stand in a rectangular formation named Formation $A$. All of the band members then move into Formation $B$, which is a different rectangular formation with six more rows, but with two fewer band members per row. How many rows are in Formation $A$?
Model Response: Let the number of rows in Formation \( A \) be \( r \) and the number of members per row be \( c \). Therefore, we have the equation:

\[
r \cdot c = 105
\]

In Formation \( B \), the number of rows is \( r + 6 \) and the number of members per row is \( c - 2 \). The total number of members remains the same, so we have:

\[
(r + 6)(c - 2) = 105
\]

Expanding this equation gives:

\[
rc - 2r + 6c - 12 = 105
\]

Since \( rc = 105 \), we can substitute \( 105 \) for \( rc \):

\[
105 - 2r + 6c - 12 = 105
\]

Simplifying this, we find:

\[
-2r + 6c - 12 = 0
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
6c - 2r = 12
\]

Dividing the entire equation by 2 results in:

\[
3c - r = 6
\]

From this, we can express \( r \) in terms of \( c \):

\[
r = 3c - 6
\]

Now we substitute \( r \) back into the equation \( rc = 105 \):

\[
(3c - 6)c = 105
\]

Expanding this gives:

\[
3c^2 - 6c = 105
\]

Rearranging leads to:

\[
3c^2 - 6c - 105 = 0
\]

Dividing the entire equation by 3 simplifies it to:

\[
c^2 - 2c - 35 = 0
\]

Next, we can factor this quadratic equation:

\[
(c - 7)(c + 5) = 0
\]

This gives us the solutions:

\[
c = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad c = -5
\]

Since \( c \) must be a positive integer, we take \( c = 7 \). Now we can find \( r \):

\[
r = 3(7) - 6 = 21 - 6 = 15
\]

Thus, the number of rows in Formation \( A \) is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]

Problem: A number is chosen uniformly at random from among the positive integers less than $10^8$. Given that the sum of the digits of the number is 9, what is the probability that the number is prime?
Model Response: To find the probability that a randomly chosen positive integer less than \(10^8\) with a digit sum of 9 is prime, we will follow these steps:

1. **Count the total numbers with a digit sum of 9**: We can represent a number with a digit sum of 9 as a solution to the equation \(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 + x_7 + x_8 = 9\), where \(0 \leq x_i \leq 9\) for each digit \(x_i\). This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using the "stars and bars" theorem.

   The number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation \(x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_8 = 9\) is given by:
   \[
   \binom{9 + 8 - 1}{8 - 1} = \binom{16}{7} = 11440.
   \]

2. **Count the prime numbers among these**: We need to check how many of these numbers are prime. A number with a digit sum of 9 can be represented in various forms, but we can focus on the properties of numbers with this digit sum.

   - The only single-digit prime with a digit sum of 9 is \(9\) itself, which is not prime.
   - For two-digit numbers, the possible combinations of digits that sum to 9 include \(90, 81, 72, 63, 54, 45, 36, 27, 18, 09\). None of these are prime.
   - For three-digit numbers, we can generate combinations like \(900, 810, 720, 630, 540, 450, 360, 270, 180, 090\) and check for primality. However, most of these will not be prime as they will be even or divisible by 3.
   - Continuing this process for four-digit, five-digit, six-digit, seven-digit, and eight-digit numbers, we will find that the vast majority will not be prime due to their structure.

   After checking through the combinations, we find that the only prime numbers that can be formed with a digit sum of 9 are \(3\) and \(9\) (but \(9\) is not prime). The only valid prime number is \(3\).

3. **Calculate the probability**: The probability \(P\) that a number chosen uniformly at random from those with a digit sum of 9 is

Problem: What is the 123,999th digit after the decimal in the decimal expansion of $\frac{123}{999}$?
Model Response: To find the 123,999th digit after the decimal in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{123}{999}\), we first simplify the fraction.

Calculating \(\frac{123}{999}\):
\[
\frac{123}{999} = \frac{123 \div 3}{999 \div 3} = \frac{41}{333}
\]

Next, we perform the division \(41 \div 333\) to find its decimal representation. 

Using long division:
1. \(41\) divided by \(333\) gives \(0\) with a remainder of \(41\).
2. We then consider \(410\) (adding a decimal point and a zero).
3. \(410\) divided by \(333\) gives \(1\) (since \(333 \times 1 = 333\)), with a remainder of \(410 - 333 = 77\).
4. Next, we consider \(770\) (adding another zero).
5. \(770\) divided by \(333\) gives \(2\) (since \(333 \times 2 = 666\)), with a remainder of \(770 - 666 = 104\).
6. Next, we consider \(1040\) (adding another zero).
7. \(1040\) divided by \(333\) gives \(3\) (since \(333 \times 3 = 999\)), with a remainder of \(1040 - 999 = 41\).

At this point, we notice that we have returned to the remainder \(41\), which means the decimal expansion will repeat from here. Thus, the decimal expansion of \(\frac{123}{999}\) is:
\[
0.123123123\ldots
\]
This shows that the decimal repeats every 3 digits: \(123\).

To find the 123,999th digit after the decimal point, we need to determine the position within the repeating block. We calculate:
\[
123999 \mod 3
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
123999 \div 3 = 41333 \quad \text{(exactly, with a remainder of 0)}
\]
This means that the 123,999th digit corresponds to the last digit of the repeating block \(123\).

The repeating block is \(123\):
- 1st digit: \(1\)
- 2nd digit: \(2\)
- 3rd digit: \(3\)

Since \(123999 \mod 3 = 0\), the 123,999th digit is the 3rd digit of the block, which is

Problem: What is the greatest whole number that MUST be a factor of the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers?
Model Response: Let the six consecutive positive odd numbers be represented as:

\[
n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8, n+10
\]

where \( n \) is the first odd number. The sum of these six numbers can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Sum} = n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) + (n+10)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\text{Sum} = 6n + (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10) = 6n + 30
\]

Now, we can factor out a 6 from the expression:

\[
\text{Sum} = 6(n + 5)
\]

Since \( n \) is a positive integer, \( n + 5 \) is also a positive integer. Therefore, the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers is always a multiple of 6.

To confirm that 6 is the greatest whole number that must be a factor, we can check the divisibility of the sum by 2 and 3:

1. **Divisibility by 2**: The sum \( 6(n + 5) \) is clearly even since it is multiplied by 6.
2. **Divisibility by 3**: The sum \( 6(n + 5) \) is also divisible by 3 since it is multiplied by 6.

Thus, the greatest whole number that must be a factor of the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers is:

Problem: Recall that if $b$ is a residue $\pmod{m}$, then the modular inverse of $b$ is the residue $c$ for which $bc \equiv 1\pmod{m}$. The table below shows the inverses of the first 9 positive residues modulo 47.  \begin{tabular}{c|ccccccccc}
$b$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\ \hline

\end{tabular}Find the modular inverse of $35\pmod{47}$.

Express your answer as an integer from $0$ to $46$, inclusive.
Model Response: To find the modular inverse of \(35 \mod 47\), we need to find an integer \(x\) such that:

\[
35x \equiv 1 \pmod{47}
\]

This means we need to solve the equation \(35x - 47k = 1\) for integers \(x\) and \(k\). We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find \(x\).

First, we apply the Euclidean algorithm to find \(\gcd(35, 47)\):

1. \(47 = 1 \cdot 35 + 12\)
2. \(35 = 2 \cdot 12 + 11\)
3. \(12 = 1 \cdot 11 + 1\)
4. \(11 = 11 \cdot 1 + 0\)

Since the last non-zero remainder is \(1\), we have \(\gcd(35, 47) = 1\), confirming that \(35\) has an inverse modulo \(47\).

Next, we backtrack to express \(1\) as a linear combination of \(35\) and \(47\):

From step 3:
\[
1 = 12 - 1 \cdot 11
\]

Substituting \(11\) from step 2:
\[
1 = 12 - 1 \cdot (35 - 2 \cdot 12) = 3 \cdot 12 - 1 \cdot 35
\]

Now substituting \(12\) from step 1:
\[
1 = 3 \cdot (47 - 1 \cdot 35) - 1 \cdot 35 = 3 \cdot 47 - 4 \cdot 35
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
1 = -4 \cdot 35 + 3 \cdot 47
\]

This shows that \(x = -4\) is a solution. To find a positive equivalent, we can add \(47\) to \(-4\):

\[
-4 + 47 = 43
\]

Thus, the modular inverse of \(35 \mod 47\) is:

Problem: What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that, out of the $n$ unit fractions $\frac{1}{k}$ where $1 \le k \le n$, exactly half of the fractions give a terminating decimal?
Model Response: To determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that exactly half of the unit fractions \( \frac{1}{k} \) for \( 1 \leq k \leq n \) give a terminating decimal, we need to understand the conditions under which a fraction \( \frac{1}{k} \) is a terminating decimal.

A fraction \( \frac{1}{k} \) is a terminating decimal if and only if the denominator \( k \) (in its simplest form) has no prime factors other than \( 2 \) and \( 5 \). This means that \( k \) can be expressed in the form \( 2^a \cdot 5^b \) for non-negative integers \( a \) and \( b \).

To find \( n \), we will count how many integers \( k \) in the range \( 1 \) to \( n \) can be expressed in the form \( 2^a \cdot 5^b \).

1. **Counting the valid \( k \)**:
   - The valid values of \( k \) are those that can be formed by multiplying powers of \( 2 \) and \( 5 \).
   - The powers of \( 2 \) can be \( 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \ldots \) up to the largest power of \( 2 \) that is \( \leq n \).
   - The powers of \( 5 \) can be \( 5^0, 5^1, 5^2, \ldots \) up to the largest power of \( 5 \) that is \( \leq n \).

2. **Finding the maximum powers**:
   - Let \( a \) be the largest integer such that \( 2^a \leq n \). This gives \( a = \lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor \).
   - Let \( b \) be the largest integer such that \( 5^b \leq n \). This gives \( b = \lfloor \log_5 n \rfloor \).

3. **Counting the combinations**:
   - The total number of valid \( k \) is given by the number of combinations of \( a \) and \( b \):
   \[
   (a + 1)(b + 1)

   where \( a + 1 \) counts the powers of \( 2 \) (from \( 0 \) to \( a \)) and \( b + 1 \) counts the powers of \( 5

\[
d_k \cdot b^k + d_{k-1} \cdot b^{k-1} + \ldots + d_1 \cdot b^1 + d_0 \cdot b^0
\]

### Step 1: Convert \(62_7\) to base 10

For \(62_7\):
- The digit \(6\) is in the \(7^1\) place.
- The digit \(2\) is in the \(7^0\) place.

Calculating the value:

\[
62_7 = 6 \cdot 7^1 + 2 \cdot 7^0 = 6 \cdot 7 + 2 \cdot 1 = 42 + 2 = 44
\]

### Step 2: Convert \(34_5\) to base 10

For \(34_5\):
- The digit \(3\) is in the \(5^1\) place.
- The digit \(4\) is in the \(5^0\) place.

Calculating the value:

\[
34_5 = 3 \cdot 5^1 + 4 \cdot 5^0 = 3 \cdot 5 + 4 \cdot 1 = 15 + 4 = 19

Problem: Captain Rusczyk tracked down a pirate who had stolen $2345_{6}$ dollars worth of goods from his ship. After winning an epic duel, the Captain demands that the pirate return $41324_{5}$ dollars. How much has the pirate gone in debt due to his two encounters with Rusczyk? Express your answer in base 10.
Model Response: To find out how much the pirate has gone into debt, we need to convert both amounts from their respective bases to base 10 and then calculate the difference.

1. **Convert \(2345_6\) to base 10:**
   \[
   2345_6 = 2 \cdot 6^3 + 3 \cdot 6^2 + 4 \cdot 6^1 + 5 \cdot 6^0
   \]
   Calculating each term:
   \[
   2 \cdot 6^3 = 2 \cdot 216 = 432
   \]
   \[
   3 \cdot 6^2 = 3 \cdot 36 = 108
   \]
   \[
   4 \cdot 6^1 = 4 \cdot 6 = 24
   \]
   \[
   5 \cdot 6^0 = 5 \cdot 1 = 5
   \]
   Now, summing these values:
   \[
   432 + 108 + 24 + 5 = 569
   \]
   Thus, \(2345_6 = 569_{10}\).

2. **Convert \(41324_5\) to base 10:**
   \[
   41324_5 = 4 \cdot 5^4 + 1 \cdot 5^3 + 3 \cdot 5^2 + 2 \cdot 5^1 + 4 \cdot 5^0
   \]
   Calculating each term:
   \[
   4 \cdot 5^4 = 4 \cdot 625 = 2500
   \]
   \[
   1 \cdot 5^3 = 1 \cdot 125 = 125
   \]
   \[
   3 \cdot 5^2 = 3 \cdot 25 = 75
   \]
   \[
   2 \cdot 5^1 = 2 \cdot 5 = 10
   \]
   \[
   4 \cdot 5^0 = 4 \cdot 1 = 4
   \]
   Now, summing these values:
   \[
   2500 + 125 + 75 + 10 + 4 = 2714
   \]
   Thus, \(41324_5 = 2714_{10}\).

3. **Calculate the debt:**
   The debt incurred by the pirate is the difference between the amount he owes and the amount he has:
   \[
   \text{Debt} = 2714 - 569 = 2145

Problem: If $a\equiv 62\pmod{99}$ and $b\equiv 75\pmod{99}$, then for what integer $n$ in the set $\{1000,1001,1002,\ldots,1097,1098\}$ is it true that $$a-b\equiv n\pmod{99}~?$$
Model Response: To solve the problem, we first need to find \( a - b \) modulo \( 99 \).

Given:
\[
a \equiv 62 \pmod{99}
\]
\[
b \equiv 75 \pmod{99}
\]

We can calculate \( a - b \):
\[
a - b \equiv 62 - 75 \pmod{99}
\]
\[
a - b \equiv -13 \pmod{99}
\]

To convert \(-13\) into a positive equivalent modulo \(99\), we can add \(99\):
\[
-13 + 99 = 86
\]
Thus,
\[
a - b \equiv 86 \pmod{99}
\]

Next, we need to find an integer \( n \) in the set \( \{1000, 1001, 1002, \ldots, 1098\} \) such that:
\[
n \equiv 86 \pmod{99}
\]

To find such \( n \), we can express \( n \) in the form:
\[
n = 99k + 86
\]
for some integer \( k \).

Now, we need to find \( k \) such that \( n \) falls within the specified range:
\[
1000 \leq 99k + 86 \leq 1098
\]

First, we solve for \( k \):
1. For the lower bound:
\[
99k + 86 \geq 1000
\]
\[
99k \geq 1000 - 86
\]
\[
99k \geq 914
\]
\[
k \geq \frac{914}{99} \approx 9.23
\]
Thus, \( k \geq 10 \).

2. For the upper bound:
\[
99k + 86 \leq 1098
\]
\[
99k \leq 1098 - 86
\]
\[
99k \leq 1012
\]
\[
k \leq \frac{1012}{99} \approx 10.22
\]
Thus, \( k \leq 10 \).

Since \( k \) must be an integer, the only possible value for \( k \) is \( 10 \).

Now we can find \( n \):
\[
n = 99 \cdot 10 + 86 = 990 + 86 = 1076
\]

Finally, we check that \( n = 1076 \) is indeed in the range \( \{1000, 1001, \ldots, 1098\} \).

Thus, the final answer is:

3. The next three primes are \(5, 7, 11\):
   \[
   5 + 7 + 11 = 23 \quad (\text{not a multiple of } 7)
   \]

4. The next three primes are \(7, 11, 13\):
   \[

   \]

5. The next three primes are \(11, 13, 17\):
   \[
   11 + 13 + 17 = 41 \quad (\text{not a multiple of } 7)
   \]

6. The next three primes are \(13, 17, 19\):
   \[
   13 + 17 + 19 = 49 \quad (49 \div 7 = 7, \text{ a multiple of } 7)

Thus, the least possible sum of three consecutive positive prime numbers that is a multiple of 7 is \(49\).

Problem: Find the unique $\textbf{odd}$ integer $t$ such that $0<t<23$ and $t+2$ is the inverse of $t$ modulo $23$.
Model Response: To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo \( 23 \), we start by setting up the equation based on the definition of modular inverses:

\[
t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Rearranging gives us:

\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]

Next, we can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

\[
t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

In our case, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we have:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

However, since we are working modulo \( 23 \), we will check integer values for \( t \) directly.

We will test odd integers \( t \) from \( 1 \) to \( 21 \):

1. **For \( t = 1 \)**:

   t + 2 = 5 \quad \text{and} \quad 3 \cdot 5 = 15 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{23}

Problem: What positive two-digit integer is exactly twice the sum of its digits?
Model Response: Let the two-digit integer be represented as \( 10a + b \), where \( a \) is the tens digit and \( b \) is the units digit. The condition states that this integer is exactly twice the sum of its digits:

\[
10a + b = 2(a + b)
\]

Expanding the right side gives:

\[
10a + b = 2a + 2b
\]

Now, we can rearrange the equation:

\[
10a + b - 2a - 2b = 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8a - b = 0
\]

From this, we can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \):

\[
b = 8a
\]

Since \( a \) and \( b \) must be digits (with \( a \) being a non-zero digit from 1 to 9 and \( b \) from 0 to 9), we need to find valid values for \( a \) such that \( b \) remains a single digit.

Given \( b = 8a \), we can analyze the possible values for \( a \):

- If \( a = 1 \), then \( b = 8 \cdot 1 = 8 \) (valid)
- If \( a = 2 \), then \( b = 8 \cdot 2 = 16 \) (not valid, as \( b \) must be a single digit)

Thus, the only valid solution is when \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 8 \). Therefore, the two-digit integer is:

\[
10a + b = 10 \cdot 1 + 8 = 18
\]

To confirm, we check if \( 18 \) is indeed twice the sum of its digits:

\[
\text{Sum of digits} = 1 + 8 = 9
\]
\[
2 \times 9 = 18
\]

This confirms our solution. Thus, the positive two-digit integer that is exactly twice the sum of its digits is:

\[
\boxed{18}

Problem: What is the least positive integer $n$ such that $80325$ divides $n!$?
Model Response: To find the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \), we first need to factor \( 80325 \) into its prime factors.

Starting with \( 80325 \):
1. Check divisibility by \( 3 \):
   \[
   80325 \div 3 = 26775
   \]
   \[
   26775 \div 3 = 8925
   \]
   \[
   8925 \div 3 = 2975
   \]
   \( 2975 \) is not divisible by \( 3 \).

2. Check divisibility by \( 5 \):
   \[
   2975 \div 5 = 595
   \]
   \[
   595 \div 5 = 119
   \]

3. Check divisibility by \( 7 \):
   \[
   119 \div 7 = 17
   \]
   \( 17 \) is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of \( 80325 \) is:
\[
80325 = 3^3 \times 5^2 \times 7^1 \times 17^1
\]

Next, we need to determine the smallest \( n \) such that \( n! \) contains at least \( 3^3 \), \( 5^2 \), \( 7^1 \), and \( 17^1 \).

We will use the formula for the highest power of a prime \( p \) dividing \( n! \):
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^k} \right\rfloor
\]

### For \( 3^3 \):
We need:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{3^k} \right\rfloor \geq 3
\]
Calculating for various \( n \):
- \( n = 5 \): \( \left\lfloor \frac{5}{3} \right\rfloor = 1 \)
- \( n = 6 \): \( \left\lfloor \frac{6}{3} \right\rfloor = 2 \)
- \( n = 7 \): \( \left\lfloor \frac{7}{3} \right\rfloor = 2 \)
- \( n = 8 \): \( \left\lfloor \frac{8}{3} \right\rfloor = 2 \)
- \( n = 9 \): \( \left\lfloor \frac{9}{3} \right\rfloor = 3 \)

Thus, \( n \geq 9 \) for \( 3

Problem: What is the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2?
Model Response: To find the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written using only the digits 0 and 2, we need to consider the properties of numbers that are multiples of 30. A number is a multiple of 30 if it is a multiple of both 3 and 10.

1. **Divisibility by 10**: A number is divisible by 10 if it ends with a 0. Therefore, our number must end with 0.

2. **Divisibility by 3**: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Since we can only use the digits 0 and 2, the sum of the digits will be \(2k\), where \(k\) is the number of 2's in the number. For \(2k\) to be divisible by 3, \(k\) must be a multiple of 3.

Now, we will construct the smallest number using the digits 0 and 2 that meets these criteria.

- The smallest number that ends with 0 and has at least one 2 is \(20\). The sum of the digits is \(2 + 0 = 2\), which is not divisible by 3.
- The next number is \(200\). The sum of the digits is \(2 + 0 + 0 = 2\), which is not divisible by 3.
- The next number is \(220\). The sum of the digits is \(2 + 2 + 0 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3.
- The next number is \(2000\). The sum of the digits is \(2 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2\), which is not divisible by 3.
- The next number is \(2020\). The sum of the digits is \(2 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3.
- The next number is \(2200\). The sum of the digits is \(2 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3.
- The next number is \(2220\). The sum of the digits is \(2 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 6\), which is divisible by 3.

Thus, \(2220\) is the first number that meets both criteria: it ends with 0 (making it divisible by 10) and the sum of its digits is 6 (making it divisible by 3).

Therefore, the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2 is 

\[
\boxed{2220}.

Problem: What is the sum of all the distinct positive two-digit factors of 144?
Model Response: To find the sum of all the distinct positive two-digit factors of 144, we first need to determine the prime factorization of 144.

The prime factorization of 144 is:
\[
144 = 12^2 = (2^2 \cdot 3)^2 = 2^4 \cdot 3^2
\]

Next, we can find all the factors of 144 by considering the combinations of its prime factors. The total number of factors can be calculated using the formula for the number of factors based on the prime factorization:
\[
(4 + 1)(2 + 1) = 5 \cdot 3 = 15
\]
Thus, 144 has 15 factors.

Now, we will list all the factors of 144:
1. \(1\)
2. \(2\)
3. \(3\)
4. \(4\)
5. \(6\)
6. \(8\)
7. \(9\)

10. \(18\)
11. \(24\)
12. \(36\)
13. \(48\)
14. \(72\)
15. \(144\)

Next, we identify the two-digit factors from this list:
- \(12\)
- \(16\)
- \(18\)
- \(24\)
- \(36\)
- \(48\)
- \(72\)

Now, we will sum these two-digit factors:
\[
12 + 16 + 18 + 24 + 36 + 48 + 72
\]

Calculating the sum step-by-step:
\[
12 + 16 = 28
\]
\[
28 + 18 = 46
\]
\[
46 + 24 = 70
\]
\[
70 + 36 = 106
\]
\[
106 + 48 = 154
\]
\[
154 + 72 = 226

Problem: At the beginning of a program, the 105 members of a marching band stand in a rectangular formation named Formation $A$. All of the band members then move into Formation $B$, which is a different rectangular formation with six more rows, but with two fewer band members per row. How many rows are in Formation $A$?
Model Response: Let \( r \) be the number of rows in Formation \( A \) and \( c \) be the number of columns in Formation \( A \). The total number of band members is given by:

\[
r \cdot c = 105
\]

In Formation \( B \), the number of rows is \( r + 6 \) and the number of columns is \( c - 2 \). The total number of band members remains the same, so we have:

\[
(r + 6)(c - 2) = 105
\]

Expanding this equation gives:

\[
rc - 2r + 6c - 12 = 105
\]

Substituting \( rc = 105 \) into the equation:

\[
105 - 2r + 6c - 12 = 105
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-2r + 6c - 12 = 0
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
6c - 2r = 12
\]

Dividing the entire equation by 2:

\[
3c - r = 6
\]

From this, we can express \( r \) in terms of \( c \):

\[
r = 3c - 6
\]

Now we substitute \( r \) back into the equation \( rc = 105 \):

\[
(3c - 6)c = 105
\]

Expanding this gives:

\[
3c^2 - 6c = 105
\]

Rearranging leads to:

\[
3c^2 - 6c - 105 = 0
\]

Dividing the entire equation by 3:

\[
c^2 - 2c - 35 = 0
\]

Next, we can factor this quadratic equation:

\[
(c - 7)(c + 5) = 0
\]

Setting each factor to zero gives:

\[
c - 7 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad c = 7
\]
\[
c + 5 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad c = -5 \quad (\text{not valid since } c \text{ must be positive})
\]

Thus, \( c = 7 \). Now substituting back to find \( r \):

\[
r = 3(7) - 6 = 21 - 6 = 15
\]

Therefore, the number of rows in Formation \( A \) is:

\[
\boxed{15}

Problem: A number is chosen uniformly at random from among the positive integers less than $10^8$. Given that the sum of the digits of the number is 9, what is the probability that the number is prime?
Model Response: To find the probability that a randomly chosen number less than \(10^8\) with a digit sum of 9 is prime, we first need to determine how many such numbers exist and how many of those are prime.

### Step 1: Count the numbers with a digit sum of 9

We can represent a number with 8 digits (including leading zeros) as \(d_1 d_2 d_3 d_4 d_5 d_6 d_7 d_8\), where \(d_i\) are the digits (0 through 9). We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:

\[
d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + d_5 + d_6 + d_7 + d_8 = 9
\]

This is a classic "stars and bars" problem, where we need to distribute 9 indistinguishable stars (the sum of the digits) into 8 distinguishable boxes (the digits). The formula for the number of solutions is given by:

\[
\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}
\]

where \(n\) is the total sum (9) and \(k\) is the number of variables (8). Thus, we have:

\[
\binom{9 + 8 - 1}{8 - 1} = \binom{16}{7}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\binom{16}{7} = \frac{16 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 11440
\]

### Step 2: Count the prime numbers among these

Next, we need to determine how many of these 11440 numbers are prime. This is a more complex task, as we need to check each number for primality.

1. **Generate all numbers**: We can generate all numbers with a digit sum of 9 and check each for primality.
2. **Primality test**: For each number, we can use a primality test (like trial division up to the square root of the number) to check if it is prime.

However, this is computationally intensive and not feasible to do manually. Instead, we can use known results or computational tools to find the number of primes among these numbers.

### Step 3: Estimate the probability

Let’s denote the number of prime numbers with a digit sum of 9 as \(P\). The probability \(P(\text{prime})\) that a number chosen uniformly at random from those with a digit sum of 9 is prime is given by:

\[
P(\text{prime}) = \frac{P}{

Problem: What is the 123,999th digit after the decimal in the decimal expansion of $\frac{123}{999}$?
Model Response: To find the 123,999th digit after the decimal in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{123}{999}\), we first need to simplify the fraction.

Calculating \(\frac{123}{999}\):

1. We can simplify \(\frac{123}{999}\) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 123 and 999. The GCD is 3.
2. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3 gives:
   \[
   \frac{123 \div 3}{999 \div 3} = \frac{41}{333}
   \]

Next, we need to find the decimal expansion of \(\frac{41}{333}\).

To do this, we perform long division of 41 by 333:

1. \(41\) divided by \(333\) gives \(0\) with a remainder of \(41\).
2. We then consider \(410\) (adding a decimal point and a zero).
3. \(410\) divided by \(333\) gives \(1\) (since \(333 \times 1 = 333\)), with a remainder of \(77\) (since \(410 - 333 = 77\)).
4. Next, we consider \(770\) (adding another zero).
5. \(770\) divided by \(333\) gives \(2\) (since \(333 \times 2 = 666\)), with a remainder of \(104\) (since \(770 - 666 = 104\)).
6. Next, we consider \(1040\) (adding another zero).
7. \(1040\) divided by \(333\) gives \(3\) (since \(333 \times 3 = 999\)), with a remainder of \(41\) (since \(1040 - 999 = 41\)).

At this point, we notice that we have returned to the remainder \(41\), which means the decimal expansion will repeat. Thus, the decimal expansion of \(\frac{41}{333}\) is:

\[
0.123123123\ldots
\]

The repeating block is \(123\), which has a length of \(3\).

To find the 123,999th digit after the decimal point, we need to determine the position of this digit within the repeating block. We do this by calculating:

\[
123999 \mod 3
\]

Calculating \(123999 \div 3\):

\[
123999 \div 3 = 41333 \quad \text{(exactly, with a remainder of 0)}
\]

Since the remainder is \(0\), the 123,999th digit corresponds to the last digit of the repeating block \(123\).

Thus, the last digit of \(123\) is \(3\).

Therefore, the 123,999th digit after

Problem: What is the greatest whole number that MUST be a factor of the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers?
Model Response: To find the greatest whole number that must be a factor of the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers, we can start by expressing the six consecutive odd numbers.

Let the first odd number be \( n \). Then the six consecutive odd numbers can be expressed as:
\[
n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8, n+10
\]

Now, we can calculate the sum of these numbers:
\[
\text{Sum} = n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) + (n+10)
\]
\[
= 6n + (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10)
\]
\[
= 6n + 30
\]

Next, we can factor this expression:
\[
\text{Sum} = 6n + 30 = 6(n + 5)
\]

From this expression, we can see that the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers is always divisible by \( 6 \).

To confirm that \( 6 \) is indeed the greatest whole number that must be a factor, we can check the divisibility of \( 6 \):
- \( 6 \) can be factored into \( 2 \) and \( 3 \).
- The sum \( 6(n + 5) \) is clearly even (divisible by \( 2 \)).
- The sum \( 6(n + 5) \) is also divisible by \( 3 \) since \( n + 5 \) can take any integer value.

Thus, the greatest whole number that must be a factor of the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers is:

\end{tabular}Find the modular inverse of $35\pmod{47}$.

Express your answer as an integer from $0$ to $46$, inclusive.
Model Response: To find the modular inverse of \(35 \mod 47\), we need to find an integer \(x\) such that:

\[
35x \equiv 1 \pmod{47}
\]

This means we need to solve the equation \(35x - 47k = 1\) for integers \(x\) and \(k\). We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find such integers.

First, we apply the Euclidean algorithm to find \(\gcd(35, 47)\):

1. \(47 = 1 \cdot 35 + 12\)
2. \(35 = 2 \cdot 12 + 11\)
3. \(12 = 1 \cdot 11 + 1\)
4. \(11 = 11 \cdot 1 + 0\)

Since the last non-zero remainder is \(1\), we have \(\gcd(35, 47) = 1\), confirming that \(35\) has an inverse modulo \(47\).

Next, we backtrack using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to express \(1\) as a linear combination of \(35\) and \(47\):

From step 3:
\[
1 = 12 - 1 \cdot 11
\]

Substituting \(11\) from step 2:
\[
11 = 35 - 2 \cdot 12 \implies 1 = 12 - 1 \cdot (35 - 2 \cdot 12) = 3 \cdot 12 - 1 \cdot 35
\]

Now substituting \(12\) from step 1:
\[
12 = 47 - 1 \cdot 35 \implies 1 = 3 \cdot (47 - 1 \cdot 35) - 1 \cdot 35 = 3 \cdot 47 - 4 \cdot 35
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
1 = 3 \cdot 47 - 4 \cdot 35
\]

This means:
\[
-4 \cdot 35 \equiv 1 \pmod{47}
\]

To find the positive equivalent of \(-4\) modulo \(47\), we compute:
\[
-4 + 47 = 43
\]

Thus, the modular inverse of \(35 \mod 47\) is:

\[
\boxed{43}

Problem: What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that, out of the $n$ unit fractions $\frac{1}{k}$ where $1 \le k \le n$, exactly half of the fractions give a terminating decimal?
Model Response: To determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that exactly half of the unit fractions \( \frac{1}{k} \) for \( 1 \leq k \leq n \) give a terminating decimal, we need to understand the conditions under which a fraction \( \frac{1}{k} \) is a terminating decimal.

A fraction \( \frac{1}{k} \) is a terminating decimal if and only if the denominator \( k \) (in its simplest form) has no prime factors other than \( 2 \) and \( 5 \). This means that \( k \) can be expressed in the form \( 2^a \cdot 5^b \) for non-negative integers \( a \) and \( b \).

To find \( n \), we need to count how many integers \( k \) in the range \( 1 \) to \( n \) are of the form \( 2^a \cdot 5^b \). 

1. **Counting the valid \( k \)**:
   - The integers \( k \) that are of the form \( 2^a \cdot 5^b \) can be generated by varying \( a \) and \( b \).
   - For \( a = 0 \), \( b \) can take values \( 0, 1, 2, \ldots \) until \( 5^b \leq n \).
   - For \( a = 1 \), \( b \) can take values \( 0, 1, 2, \ldots \) until \( 2 \cdot 5^b \leq n \).
   - This continues until \( 2^a \) exceeds \( n \).

2. **Finding the total count**:
   - The maximum value of \( a \) is determined by \( 2^a \leq n \), which gives \( a \leq \log_2(n) \).
   - The maximum value of \( b \) is determined by \( 5^b \leq n \), which gives \( b \leq \log_5(n) \).

3. **Calculating the total**:
   - For each \( a \) from \( 0 \) to \( \lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor \), we can find the maximum \( b \) such that \( 2^a \cdot 5^b \leq n \).
   - The number of valid \( k \) values is the count of pairs \( (a, b) \) such that \( 2^a \cdot 5^b \leq n \).

4. **Setting up the equation**:
   - We want the count of valid \( k \) values to equal \( \frac{n

   \[
   = 4 \cdot 625 + 1 \cdot 125 + 3 \cdot 25 + 2 \cdot 5 + 4 \cdot 1

   The debt is the amount the pirate owes minus the amount he has:
   \[
   \text{Debt} = 41324_5 - 2345_6 = 2714 - 569 = 2145
   \]

Thus, the amount the pirate has gone into debt due to his encounters with Captain Rusczyk is \(\boxed{2145}\).

Problem: If $a\equiv 62\pmod{99}$ and $b\equiv 75\pmod{99}$, then for what integer $n$ in the set $\{1000,1001,1002,\ldots,1097,1098\}$ is it true that $$a-b\equiv n\pmod{99}~?$$
Model Response: To solve the problem, we start with the given congruences:

1. \( a \equiv 62 \pmod{99} \)
2. \( b \equiv 75 \pmod{99} \)

We need to find \( n \) such that:

\[
a - b \equiv n \pmod{99}
\]

First, we calculate \( a - b \):

\[
a - b \equiv 62 - 75 \pmod{99}
\]

Calculating \( 62 - 75 \):

\[
62 - 75 = -13
\]

Now, we need to express \(-13\) in a positive equivalent modulo \(99\):

\[
-13 \equiv 99 - 13 = 86 \pmod{99}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
a - b \equiv 86 \pmod{99}
\]

Now, we need to find \( n \) in the range \( \{1000, 1001, 1002, \ldots, 1098\} \) such that:

\[
n \equiv 86 \pmod{99}
\]

To find the values of \( n \) that satisfy this condition, we can express \( n \) in the form:

\[
n = 99k + 86
\]

for some integer \( k \). We need to find \( k \) such that \( n \) falls within the specified range. 

Setting up the inequality:

\[
1000 \leq 99k + 86 \leq 1098
\]

Subtracting \(86\) from all parts:

\[
914 \leq 99k \leq 1012
\]

Now, dividing the entire inequality by \(99\):

\[
\frac{914}{99} \leq k \leq \frac{1012}{99}
\]

Calculating the bounds:

\[
\frac{914}{99} \approx 9.23 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1012}{99} \approx 10.22
\]

Thus, \( k \) can take the integer values \( 10 \) (since \( k \) must be an integer). 

Now substituting \( k = 10 \) back into the equation for \( n \):

\[
n = 99 \cdot 10 + 86 = 990 + 86 = 1076
\]

Finally, we check if \( 1076 \) is within the range \( \{1000, 1001, \ldots, 1098\} \):

Since \( 1076 \) is indeed in this range, we conclude that:

\[
\boxed{1076}

Problem: Three consecutive positive prime numbers have a sum that is a multiple of 7. What is the least possible sum?
Model Response: To find three consecutive positive prime numbers whose sum is a multiple of 7, we can start by listing the first few sets of three consecutive primes and calculating their sums.

1. The first three primes are \(2, 3, 5\):
   \[
   2 + 3 + 5 = 10 \quad (\text{not a multiple of } 7)
   \]

2. The next three primes are \(3, 5, 7\):
   \[
   3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \quad (\text{not a multiple of } 7)
   \]

3. The next three primes are \(5, 7, 11\):
   \[
   5 + 7 + 11 = 23 \quad (\text{not a multiple of } 7)
   \]

4. The next three primes are \(7, 11, 13\):
   \[
   7 + 11 + 13 = 31 \quad (\text{not a multiple of } 7)
   \]

5. The next three primes are \(11, 13, 17\):
   \[
   11 + 13 + 17 = 41 \quad (\text{not a multiple of } 7)
   \]

6. The next three primes are \(13, 17, 19\):
   \[
   13 + 17 + 19 = 49 \quad (\text{is a multiple of } 7)
   \]

The sum \(49\) is the first sum we found that is a multiple of \(7\). 

Thus, the least possible sum of three consecutive positive prime numbers that is a multiple of \(7\) is \(\boxed{49}\).

Problem: Find the unique $\textbf{odd}$ integer $t$ such that $0<t<23$ and $t+2$ is the inverse of $t$ modulo $23$.
Model Response: To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo \( 23 \), we start with the equation:

\[
t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Expanding this gives:

\[
t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Rearranging leads to:

\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]

This is a quadratic equation in \( t \). We can use the quadratic formula to solve for \( t \):

\[
t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values gives:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

Next, we need to find integer solutions for \( t \). Since we are working modulo \( 23 \), we can test odd integers \( t \) from \( 1 \) to \( 21 \):

1. **For \( t = 1 \)**:
   \[
   1 + 2 = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad 1 \cdot 3 = 3 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{23}
   \]

2. **For \( t = 3 \)**:
   \[
   3 + 2 = 5 \quad \text{and} \quad 3 \cdot 5 = 15 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{23}
   \]

3. **For \( t = 5 \)**:
   \[
   5 + 2 = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad 5 \cdot 7 = 35 \equiv 12 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{23}
   \]

4. **For \( t = 7 \)**:
   \[
   7 + 2 = 9 \quad \text{and} \quad 7 \cdot 9 = 63 \equiv 17 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{23}
   \]

5. **For \( t = 9 \)**:
   \[
   9 + 2 = 11 \quad \text{and} \quad 9 \cdot 11 = 99 \equiv 8 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{23}

Problem: What positive two-digit integer is exactly twice the sum of its digits?
Model Response: Let the two-digit integer be represented as \( 10a + b \), where \( a \) is the tens digit and \( b \) is the units digit. The problem states that this integer is exactly twice the sum of its digits, which can be expressed mathematically as:

\[
10a + b = 2(a + b)
\]

Expanding the right side gives:

\[
10a + b = 2a + 2b
\]

Now, we can rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving \( a \) and \( b \):

\[
10a + b - 2a - 2b = 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8a - b = 0
\]

From this, we can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \):

\[
b = 8a
\]

Since \( a \) and \( b \) are digits, \( a \) must be a positive integer from 1 to 9 (as it is the tens digit of a two-digit number), and \( b \) must be a single digit (0 to 9). Therefore, we need to find values of \( a \) such that \( b = 8a \) remains a single digit.

The possible values for \( a \) are:

- If \( a = 1 \), then \( b = 8 \times 1 = 8 \) (valid)
- If \( a = 2 \), then \( b = 8 \times 2 = 16 \) (invalid, as \( b \) must be a single digit)

Thus, the only valid solution is \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 8 \). Therefore, the two-digit integer is:

\[
10a + b = 10 \times 1 + 8 = 18
\]

To confirm, we check if \( 18 \) is indeed twice the sum of its digits:

\[
\text{Sum of digits} = 1 + 8 = 9
\]
\[
2 \times 9 = 18
\]

This is correct. Therefore, the positive two-digit integer that is exactly twice the sum of its digits is:

Problem: What is the least positive integer $n$ such that $80325$ divides $n!$?
Model Response: To find the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \), we first need to factor \( 80325 \) into its prime factors.

Starting with \( 80325 \):
1. Check divisibility by \( 3 \):
   \[
   80325 \div 3 = 26775
   \]
   \[
   26775 \div 3 = 8925
   \]
   \[
   8925 \div 3 = 2975
   \]
   \( 2975 \) is not divisible by \( 3 \).

2. Check divisibility by \( 5 \):
   \[
   2975 \div 5 = 595
   \]
   \[
   595 \div 5 = 119
   \]

3. Check divisibility by \( 7 \):
   \[
   119 \div 7 = 17
   \]
   \( 17 \) is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of \( 80325 \) is:
\[
80325 = 3^3 \times 5^2 \times 7^1 \times 17^1
\]

Next, we need to determine the smallest \( n \) such that \( n! \) contains at least \( 3^3 \), \( 5^2 \), \( 7^1 \), and \( 17^1 \).

### Step 1: Count the factors in \( n! \)

The number of times a prime \( p \) divides \( n! \) is given by:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^k} \right\rfloor
\]

#### For \( p = 3 \):
We need at least \( 3 \) factors of \( 3 \):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{3} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{9} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{27} \right\rfloor \geq 3
\]

#### For \( p = 5 \):
We need at least \( 2 \) factors of \( 5 \):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{25} \right\rfloor \geq 2
\]

#### For \( p = 7 \):
We need at least \( 1 \) factor of \( 7 \):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{7} \right\rfloor \geq 1
\]

#### For \( p = 17 \):
We need at least \( 1 \) factor of \( 17 \):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{17} \right\rfloor \geq 1
\]

### Step 2: Find the smallest \( n \)

1. **For \( 3 \)**:

Problem: What is the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2?
Model Response: To find the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written using only the digits 0 and 2, we need to consider the properties of numbers that are multiples of 30. A number is a multiple of 30 if it is divisible by both 3 and 10.

1. **Divisibility by 10**: A number is divisible by 10 if it ends in 0. Therefore, our number must end with the digit 0.

2. **Divisibility by 3**: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Since we are only using the digits 0 and 2, the sum of the digits will be \(2k\), where \(k\) is the number of times the digit 2 appears in the number. For \(2k\) to be divisible by 3, \(k\) must be a multiple of 3.

Now, we need to construct the smallest number that meets these criteria:

- The number must end in 0.
- The number must contain at least 3 twos (to ensure \(k\) is a multiple of 3).

The smallest number that satisfies these conditions is \(2220\):

- It ends in 0.
- The sum of the digits is \(2 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 6\), which is divisible by 3.

Thus, the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2 is:

Problem: What is the sum of all the distinct positive two-digit factors of 144?
Model Response: To find the sum of all the distinct positive two-digit factors of 144, we first need to determine the factors of 144.

1. **Find the prime factorization of 144:**
   \[
   144 = 12 \times 12 = (2^2 \times 3) \times (2^2 \times 3) = 2^4 \times 3^2
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of factors:**
   The formula for the number of factors based on the prime factorization \( p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \) is given by:
   \[
   (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)
   \]
   For \( 144 = 2^4 \times 3^2 \):
   \[
   (4 + 1)(2 + 1) = 5 \times 3 = 15
   \]
   So, 144 has 15 factors.

3. **List all factors of 144:**
   The factors can be found by considering all combinations of the prime factors:
   - \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 144 \)

4. **Identify the two-digit factors:**
   From the list of factors, the two-digit factors are:
   - \( 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72 \)

5. **Sum the two-digit factors:**
   Now we calculate the sum:
   \[
   12 + 16 + 18 + 24 + 36 + 48 + 72
   \]
   Performing the addition step-by-step:
   \[
   12 + 16 = 28
   \]
   \[
   28 + 18 = 46
   \]
   \[
   46 + 24 = 70
   \]
   \[
   70 + 36 = 106
   \]
   \[
   106 + 48 = 154
   \]
   \[
   154 + 72 = 226
   \]

Thus, the sum of all the distinct positive two-digit factors of 144 is \(\boxed{226}\).

Problem: At the beginning of a program, the 105 members of a marching band stand in a rectangular formation named Formation $A$. All of the band members then move into Formation $B$, which is a different rectangular formation with six more rows, but with two fewer band members per row. How many rows are in Formation $A$?
Model Response: Let \( r \) be the number of rows in Formation \( A \) and \( c \) be the number of columns in Formation \( A \). The total number of members in the band is given by:

\[
rc = 105
\]

In Formation \( B \), the number of rows is \( r + 6 \) and the number of columns is \( c - 2 \). The total number of members in Formation \( B \) is also 105, so we have:

\[
(r + 6)(c - 2) = 105
\]

Now we can expand this equation:

\[
rc - 2r + 6c - 12 = 105
\]

Substituting \( rc = 105 \) into the equation gives:

\[
105 - 2r + 6c - 12 = 105
\]

Simplifying this, we find:

\[
-2r + 6c - 12 = 0
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
6c - 2r = 12
\]

Dividing the entire equation by 2 results in:

\[
3c - r = 6
\]

Now we can express \( r \) in terms of \( c \):

\[
r = 3c - 6
\]

Substituting this expression for \( r \) back into the equation \( rc = 105 \):

\[
(3c - 6)c = 105
\]

Expanding this gives:

\[
3c^2 - 6c = 105
\]

Rearranging leads to:

\[
3c^2 - 6c - 105 = 0
\]

Dividing the entire equation by 3 simplifies it to:

\[
c^2 - 2c - 35 = 0
\]

Now we can factor this quadratic equation:

\[
(c - 7)(c + 5) = 0
\]

This gives us the solutions:

\[
c = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad c = -5
\]

Since \( c \) must be a positive integer, we have \( c = 7 \). Now substituting back to find \( r \):

\[
r = 3(7) - 6 = 21 - 6 = 15
\]

Thus, the number of rows in Formation \( A \) is:

\[

Problem: A number is chosen uniformly at random from among the positive integers less than $10^8$. Given that the sum of the digits of the number is 9, what is the probability that the number is prime?
Model Response: To solve the problem, we need to find the probability that a randomly chosen positive integer less than \(10^8\) with a digit sum of 9 is prime.

### Step 1: Count the total numbers with a digit sum of 9

We can represent a number with a digit sum of 9 as a solution to the equation:

\[
x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 + x_7 + x_8 = 9
\]

where \(0 \leq x_i \leq 9\) for each digit \(x_i\). The number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation can be found using the "stars and bars" combinatorial method. The formula for the number of solutions is given by:

\[
\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}
\]

where \(n\) is the total we want (9 in this case) and \(k\) is the number of variables (8 digits).

Thus, we have:

\[
\binom{9 + 8 - 1}{8 - 1} = \binom{16}{7}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\binom{16}{7} = \frac{16 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 11440
\]

### Step 2: Count the prime numbers among these

Next, we need to determine how many of these numbers are prime. 

To do this, we can generate all numbers with a digit sum of 9 and check each for primality. However, this is computationally intensive. Instead, we can use a more theoretical approach.

1. **Distribution of Primes**: The density of prime numbers among integers decreases as numbers get larger. The prime number theorem gives us an approximation of the number of primes less than \(N\) as \(\frac{N}{\log N}\).

2. **Estimate the number of primes**: The total number of integers less than \(10^8\) is \(10^8 - 1\). The number of primes less than \(10^8\) is approximately:

\[
\frac{10^8}{\log(10^8)} \approx \frac{10^8}{18.42} \approx 5.43 \times 10^6
\]

3. **Estimate the proportion of numbers with digit sum 9**: The proportion of numbers with a digit sum of 9 among all numbers is relatively small. However, we can assume that the distribution of primes among these numbers is similar to that of the overall distribution.

### Step 3: Calculate the probability

The probability \(P\) that a number with a digit sum of 9 is prime can be approximated as:

\[
P \approx \frac{\text{Number of primes with digit sum 9}}{\text{Total numbers with digit sum 9}} \approx \frac{5.43 \times 10^6 \cdot \text{(proportion of digit sum 9)}}{11440}

Problem: What is the 123,999th digit after the decimal in the decimal expansion of $\frac{123}{999}$?
Model Response: To find the 123,999th digit after the decimal in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{123}{999}\), we first simplify the fraction.

Calculating \(\frac{123}{999}\):
\[
\frac{123}{999} = \frac{123 \div 3}{999 \div 3} = \frac{41}{333}
\]

Next, we perform the division \(41 \div 333\) to find its decimal expansion. 

Using long division:
1. \(41\) is less than \(333\), so we start with \(0.\).
2. We consider \(410\) (adding a decimal and a zero).
3. \(333\) goes into \(410\) once, so we write \(0.1\) and subtract \(333\) from \(410\):
   \[
   410 - 333 = 77
   \]
4. Bring down another \(0\) to make \(770\).
5. \(333\) goes into \(770\) twice, so we write \(0.12\) and subtract \(666\) from \(770\):
   \[
   770 - 666 = 104
   \]
6. Bring down another \(0\) to make \(1040\).
7. \(333\) goes into \(1040\) three times, so we write \(0.123\) and subtract \(999\) from \(1040\):
   \[
   1040 - 999 = 41
   \]
8. Bring down another \(0\) to make \(410\) again.

At this point, we see that the decimal expansion starts repeating:
\[
\frac{123}{999} = 0.123123123\ldots
\]
The repeating block is \(123\), which has a length of \(3\).

To find the 123,999th digit after the decimal point, we calculate the position within the repeating block:
\[
123,999 \mod 3
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
123,999 \div 3 = 41,333 \quad \text{(exactly, with a remainder of 0)}
\]
Thus,
\[
123,999 \mod 3 = 0
\]
This means the 123,999th digit corresponds to the last digit of the repeating block \(123\).

The last digit of \(123\) is \(3\).

Therefore, the 123,999th digit after the decimal in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{123}{999}\) is:
\[

Problem: What is the greatest whole number that MUST be a factor of the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers?
Model Response: To find the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers, we can represent the first odd number in the sequence as \( n \). The six consecutive odd numbers can then be expressed as:

\[
n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8, n+10
\]

The sum of these numbers is:

\[
n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) + (n+10)
\]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
6n + (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10) = 6n + 30
\]

Thus, the sum of the six consecutive odd numbers is:

\[
6n + 30
\]

We can factor this expression:

\[
6n + 30 = 6(n + 5)
\]

From this factorization, we can see that \( 6 \) is a factor of the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers. 

To determine if there are any other factors that must always be present, we can analyze the expression \( 6(n + 5) \). The number \( 6 \) can be factored into its prime components:

\[
6 = 2 \times 3
\]

Since \( n \) is any positive odd number, \( n + 5 \) will also be an integer, but it can be either even or odd depending on the value of \( n \). Therefore, \( n + 5 \) does not guarantee any additional factors.

Thus, the only factor that must always be present in the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers is \( 6 \).

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]

Problem: Recall that if $b$ is a residue $\pmod{m}$, then the modular inverse of $b$ is the residue $c$ for which $bc \equiv 1\pmod{m}$. The table below shows the inverses of the first 9 positive residues modulo 47.  \begin{tabular}{c|ccccccccc}
$b$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\ \hline
inverse of $\,b$ & 1 & 24 & 16 & 12 & 19 & 8 & 27 & 6 & 21
\end{tabular}Find the modular inverse of $35\pmod{47}$.

Express your answer as an integer from $0$ to $46$, inclusive.
Model Response: To find the modular inverse of \(35\) modulo \(47\), we need to find an integer \(x\) such that:

\[
35x \equiv 1 \pmod{47}
\]

We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find \(x\). First, we apply the Euclidean algorithm to find \(\gcd(35, 47)\):

1. \(47 = 1 \cdot 35 + 12\)
2. \(35 = 2 \cdot 12 + 11\)
3. \(12 = 1 \cdot 11 + 1\)
4. \(11 = 11 \cdot 1 + 0\)

Since the last non-zero remainder is \(1\), we have \(\gcd(35, 47) = 1\), which means \(35\) has an inverse modulo \(47\).

Next, we backtrack to express \(1\) as a linear combination of \(35\) and \(47\):

From step 3:
\[
1 = 12 - 1 \cdot 11
\]

Substituting \(11\) from step 2:
\[
1 = 12 - 1 \cdot (35 - 2 \cdot 12) = 3 \cdot 12 - 1 \cdot 35
\]

Now substituting \(12\) from step 1:
\[
1 = 3 \cdot (47 - 1 \cdot 35) - 1 \cdot 35 = 3 \cdot 47 - 4 \cdot 35
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
1 = -4 \cdot 35 + 3 \cdot 47
\]

This means:
\[
-4 \cdot 35 \equiv 1 \pmod{47}
\]

To find the positive equivalent of \(-4\) modulo \(47\), we compute:
\[
-4 + 47 = 43
\]

Thus, the modular inverse of \(35\) modulo \(47\) is:

\[
\boxed{43}
\]

Problem: What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that, out of the $n$ unit fractions $\frac{1}{k}$ where $1 \le k \le n$, exactly half of the fractions give a terminating decimal?
Model Response: To determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that exactly half of the unit fractions \( \frac{1}{k} \) for \( 1 \leq k \leq n \) give a terminating decimal, we need to understand the conditions under which a fraction \( \frac{1}{k} \) is a terminating decimal.

A fraction \( \frac{1}{k} \) is a terminating decimal if and only if the denominator \( k \) (in its simplest form) has no prime factors other than \( 2 \) and \( 5 \). This means that \( k \) can be expressed in the form \( 2^a \cdot 5^b \) for non-negative integers \( a \) and \( b \).

### Step 1: Count the numbers \( k \) that are of the form \( 2^a \cdot 5^b \)

We will count how many integers \( k \) satisfy \( 1 \leq k \leq n \) and are of the form \( 2^a \cdot 5^b \).

- The powers of \( 2 \) that are less than or equal to \( n \) are \( 1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^m \) where \( 2^m \leq n \). The largest \( m \) is \( \lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor \).
- The powers of \( 5 \) that are less than or equal to \( n \) are \( 1, 5, 25, \ldots, 5^p \) where \( 5^p \leq n \). The largest \( p \) is \( \lfloor \log_5 n \rfloor \).

### Step 2: Calculate the total count of valid \( k \)

The total number of valid \( k \) can be calculated as follows:
- For each \( a \) from \( 0 \) to \( m \) (where \( m = \lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor \)), we can pair it with each \( b \) from \( 0 \) to \( p \) (where \( p = \lfloor \log_5 n \rfloor \)).
- Thus, the total count of valid \( k \) is \( (m + 1)(p + 1) \).

### Step 3: Set up the equation

We want this count to equal half of \( n \):
\[
(m + 1)(p + 1) = \frac{n}{2}
\]

### Step 4: Find the smallest \( n \)

We will test small values of \( n \) to find the smallest integer that satisfies the equation.

1. **For \( n = 1 \)**:
   - Valid \( k \): \( 1 \) (count = 1)
   - \( 1 = \frac{1}{2} \) (not satisfied)

2. **For \( n = 2 \)**:
   - Valid \( k \): \( 1, 2 \) (count = 2)
   - \( 2 = \frac{2}{2} \) (satisfied)

3. **For \(

Problem: What is $62_7+34_5$ when expressed in base 10?
Model Response: To convert the numbers \(62_7\) and \(34_5\) to base 10, we will use the formula for converting from base \(b\) to base 10, which is:

\[
\text{Value in base 10} = d_k \cdot b^k + d_{k-1} \cdot b^{k-1} + \ldots + d_1 \cdot b^1 + d_0 \cdot b^0
\]

where \(d_i\) are the digits of the number in base \(b\).

**Step 1: Convert \(62_7\) to base 10.**

The digits are \(6\) and \(2\), and the base is \(7\):

\[
62_7 = 6 \cdot 7^1 + 2 \cdot 7^0 = 6 \cdot 7 + 2 \cdot 1 = 42 + 2 = 44
\]

**Step 2: Convert \(34_5\) to base 10.**

The digits are \(3\) and \(4\), and the base is \(5\):

\[
34_5 = 3 \cdot 5^1 + 4 \cdot 5^0 = 3 \cdot 5 + 4 \cdot 1 = 15 + 4 = 19
\]

**Step 3: Add the two base 10 values.**

Now we add the two results:

\[
44 + 19 = 63
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{63}
